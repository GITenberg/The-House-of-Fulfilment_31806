<h3 class="padtop">CHAPTER ONE</h3>


<p>Harriet Blair was seventeen when she went
with her father and mother and her brother
Austen to New Orleans, to the marriage of
an older brother, Alexander, the father&rsquo;s
business representative at that place. It
was characteristic of the Blairs that they declined
the hospitality of the bride&rsquo;s family,
and from the hotel attended, punctiliously
and formally, the occasions for which they
had come. It takes ease to accept hospitality.</p>

<p>Alexander Blair, the father, banker and
capitalist, of Vermont stock, now the richest
man in Louisville, was of a stern ruggedness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
unsoftened by a long and successful
career in the South, while his wife, the
daughter of a Scotch schoolmaster settled
in Pennsylvania, was the possessor of a
thrifty closeness and strong, practical sense.</p>

<p>Alexander, their oldest son, a man of
thirty, to whose wedding they had come, was
what was natural to expect, a literal, shrewd
man, with a strong sense of duty as he saw it.
His long, clean-shaven upper lip, above a
beard, looked slightly grim, and his straight-gazing,
blue-grey eyes were stern.</p>

<p>The second son, Austen, was clean-featured,
handsome and blond, but he was
also, by report, the shrewd and promising
son of his father, even as his brother was reported
before him.</p>

<p>Harriet, the daughter, was a silent, cold-looking
girl, who wrapped herself in reserve
as a cover for self-consciousness but, observing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
closely, thought to her own conclusions.
She had a disillusioning way of baring
facts in these communings, which showed
life to her very honestly but without romance
or glamour.</p>

<p>At the wedding, sitting in her white dress
by her father and mother in the flower-bedecked
parlours of the Randolphs, Harriet
looked at her brother, standing by the girl
of seventeen whom he had just married, and
saw things much as they were. In Molly,
the bride of an hour, with her child&rsquo;s face
and red-brown hair and shadowy lashes, she
saw a descendant of pleasure-loving, ease-taking
Southerners. Molly&rsquo;s father, from
what Austen had said, was the dispenser of
a lavish and improvident hospitality and a
genial dweller on the edge of bankruptcy,
while the mother, a belle of the &rsquo;40&rsquo;s, some
one had told the Blairs, seemed just the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
woman to marry her only child to a man
opposed to her people in creed, politics and
habits&mdash;which in 1860 meant something&mdash;but
son of one of the richest men in the
South.</p>

<p>Harriet ate her supper close by her father
and mother. She did not know how to mix
with these gay, incidental Southerners, and
sitting there, went on with her communings.
She could explain it on the Randolph side,
but why Alexander was marrying Molly she
could not understand. Shy and self-conscious,
she knew vaguely of a thing called
love. She had met it in her reading rather
than seen its acting forces anywhere about
her. To be sure, her brother Austen had
been engaged to a Miss Ransome of Woodford
County, a fashionable Kentucky beauty.
The Blairs were a narrowly religious people.
Harriet, a school-girl then, had stood at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
window of the stately new stone house in
Louisville which the Blairs called home, and,
watching the fashionable world flow in and
out of the high old brick cottage across the
street, where Miss Ransome spent much
time with a great-aunt, had wondered.</p>

<p>But love had not proved such a factor
after all. Austen&rsquo;s engagement had been
broken.</p>

<p>Harriet went back to Kentucky with the
question of Alexander and Molly still open.</p>

<p>A year later her father went South again.
War was loudly threatening, and he had
large interests in Louisiana and Mississippi.
There was a certain sympathy and understanding
between the stern, silent man and
his daughter, and he suggested that she go
with him and see the child newly born to
Alexander and Molly.</p>

<p>But, reaching New Orleans to find his son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
gone to Mobile, concerning these same interests,
Mr. Blair decided to join him, and
Molly being about to leave for her father&rsquo;s
plantation with the baby and nurse, that she
might the more rapidly convalesce, it was
decided that Harriet accompany her.</p>

<p>The two weeks at Cannes Brul&eacute;e were
strange to the girl, thus introduced to a
Southern house overflowing with guests and
servants, and she moved amid the idling and
irresponsibility, the laughter and persiflage,
with a sense of being outside of it all, and the
fault, try as she would, her own.</p>

<p>This feeling was strongest that Sunday
afternoon when the gaiety and badinage
seemed to centre about a new arrival, a
handsome, silver-aureoled Catholic priest,
confessor to half the parish. Genial, polished,
and affable, his very charm seemed to
the Calvinistic-bred Harriet to invest him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
the more with the seductions of Romanism,
as she had been taught to regard them.</p>

<p>There were music, cards, a huge bowl
frosted with the icy beverage within, and to
the stunned young Puritan the genial little
priest in the midst seemed smiling a bacchanalian
benediction over all.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above chatter and music Molly&rsquo;s
voice arose, gay but insistent, Molly
there in the big chair, pale and big-eyed, her
strength so slow to return, herself a child in
her little muslin dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Baby is four weeks old,&rdquo; Molly was declaring,
&ldquo;and here is Father Bonot from service
at Cannes Brul&eacute;e and so with his vestments.
I&rsquo;m here and Harriet&rsquo;s here, and
mamma&rsquo;s here, and everybody else is a
cousin or something. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know when I can get to church. P&rsquo;tite shall
be baptized here, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
And before the slower comprehension of
the dazed Harriet had grasped the meaning
of the ensuing preparations&mdash;the draping
of the pier-table, the lighting of waxen candles&mdash;a
sudden silence had fallen; the gay
abandon of these mercurial Southerners had
given place to reverent awe, even to tears, as
the new-born representative of the Puritan
Blairs was brought in, in robes like cascades
of lace, while of all that followed, the one
thing seeming to reach the comprehension of
Harriet was the chanting monotone of
Father Bonot saying above the child, &ldquo;Mary
Alexina&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later Molly and Harriet went back to
New Orleans, to find Alexander there but
his father gone up to Vicksburg. Molly was
to keep Harriet with her until his return.</p>

<p>Only the girl knew what it meant to find
herself near her brother. It was as if here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
was something sane, rational, stable, by
which to re-establish poise and standards.
Harriet would have trembled to oppose her
brother, so that to see Molly and Alexander
together was a revelation. His sternness
and his displeasure alike broke as a wave
upon Molly, and as a wave receded, leaving
her, as a wave would leave the sand, pretty
and sparkling and smiling. Other things
were revelations to Harriet, too.</p>

<p>Going down to breakfast one morning, she
found her brother clean-shaven, immaculate,
monosyllabic, awaiting the overdue meal.
The French windows were open to the scent
of myriads of roses outside, and also to the
morning sun, far too high. The negro servants
were hurrying to and fro, Molly nowhere
visible.</p>

<p>Later, as the dishes were being uncovered,
she appeared, her unstockinged little feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
thrust into pretty French slippers, and her
cambric nightgown by no means concealed
by a neglig&eacute;e, all lace and ribbons, hastily
caught together. Yet she was pretty, pretty
like a lovely and naughty child.</p>

<p>Nor did the embarrassment of Harriet,
the presence of the servants, or her husband&rsquo;s
cold preoccupation with his breakfast disturb
Molly, who trailed along with apparent
unconcern until, reaching his elbow, she
threw a wicked glance at Harriet, then kissed
him on that spot on his head which, but
for a few carefully disposed strands, must
have been termed bald.</p>

<p>At the thing, absurd as it was, there swept
over Harriet the hot shrinking of one made
conscious of sex for the first time. With
throbbing at throat and ears, she gazed into
her plate, her feeling, oddly enough, centring
in keen revulsion against her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
But Molly was dragging a chair to his
elbow. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the fricassee made of,
Alexander?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her husband vouching her no reply, she
slipped an arm about his neck, and, leaning
over, drew his fork to her mouth and
tasted the morsel thereon.</p>

<p>Then she turned her head sideways to regard
him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t frown it back, Alec, the
smile I mean. I adore you when you don&rsquo;t
want to and have to let it come. Acknowledge
now, this is the way to breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Harriet, who had been led to regard
playfulness as little less than vice, was conscious
of Molly trying to force a ripe fig between
Alexander&rsquo;s lips, repressed, thin lips
upon which softening sat as if afraid of itself
and her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Molly was explaining, &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t get down sooner. P&rsquo;tite was making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
the most absurd catches at her mosquito
bar, and Celeste refusing to laugh at her.
You haven&rsquo;t finished your breakfast? Why
must you always hurry off? No&rdquo;&mdash;her
hand against his mouth, he, risen now, she
on a knee in her chair, clinging to him&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
tell me any more about Sumter having
been fired upon, and your being worried
over business. I hate business. What&rsquo;s
anything this moment, if you would only see
it, compared with me, and ripe figs dipped
in cream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the triumph of her laugh as, his
arms suddenly around her, he grasped her,
lifted, enfolded her for a moment, then as
fiercely put her from him and went out, leaving
Harriet sick, shaken, at this sight of
human passion seen for the first time.</p>

<p>The following day Harriet&rsquo;s father returned
and she went home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
When she next saw her brother it was
in Louisville, where he was driven back to
his own people by reason of his Northern
creed and sympathies. His father-in-law
had been among the first to fall in defence
of the Confederacy, and with Alexander,
now, was his mother-in-law, widowed and
dependent, and a wife in this sense changed
from child to woman&mdash;that she was a
fiercely avowed Southerner to the fibre of
her.</p>

<p>With his little family he remained in
Louisville a year. If his own people wondered
at the extravagance of his wife and
mother-in-law at a time when incomes were
so seriously shrunken, Alexander was too
much a Blair for even a Blair to approach
the subject.</p>

<p>The child was sent daily to his mother&rsquo;s&mdash;he
saw to that&mdash;a pretty baby, the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
Mary Alexina, and robed like a young princess;
but beyond this he seemed to discourage
intimacy between the households. Certainly
there was no common ground, the
business judgment, large experience, and the
integrity of the Blairs being in the constant
service of the government, while rumor had
it that the home of young Mrs. Alexander
Blair was the social rallying place for Southern
sympathizers generally.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of big affairs, Alexander
arranged otherwise for the maintenance
of his wife&rsquo;s mother, whom it was his
to support for the few remaining years of her
life, and went to Europe with Molly and the
child. Long after it came to Harriet&rsquo;s hearing
that the frequent presence of a young
Confederate officer at his house had led to
the step.</p>

<p>It was four years from this time, in 1867,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
that Alexander Blair, the senior, died, to be
shortly followed by his wife.</p>

<p>Though the son Alexander returned to
Louisville of necessity, following these
events, he left Molly and the child in Washington
with some of her people there. And
though his interests became centred in
Louisville again, he never brought his family
back, but went and came between the two
places. In domestic infelicity it is our own
people we would hide it from longest. It
was two years after, in &rsquo;69, that Alexander
met his end with the shocking suddenness
of accidental death as he was returning East
to Molly and the child.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>


<p>The leisure of a summer evening had fallen
with the twilight. Along that street in Louisville
wherein stood the Blair house, with its
splendid lawn, and its carriage driveway
issuing through a tall, iron gate, front doors
were opening and family groups gathering.
The yards wore the fresh green of June. A
homecoming crumple-horn ambled by, her
bag swinging heavily. In the South, in
1870, cities were villages overgrown.</p>

<p>In the parlour of her home Harriet Blair
sat, awaiting the arrival of her brother Austen
from Washington, where he had gone to
bring back their dead brother&rsquo;s child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
Harriet, at twenty-six, in lustreless mourning,
was handsome and, some might have
said, cold. Her face was finely chiselled, and
framed with light hair waving from its parting
in curves regular as the flutings of a
shell. There was a poise, a composure
about this Harriet, making her unlike the
tall, shy girl of nine years before.</p>

<p>As the bell rang she laid down her book
and rose, and a second later Austen entered,
leading a little girl with a round, short-cropped
head. His eyes met his sister&rsquo;s in
greeting, then he loosed the child&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;This is your Aunt Harriet, Alexina,&rdquo; he
said, and stepped across the room to stand
before the mantel and watch the two.</p>

<p>Harriet bent and kissed the small cheek.
Demonstration, even to this extent, meant
much for a Blair. Then she crossed the
room. She was more than ordinarily tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
for a woman, with form proportioned to
length of limb, and the beauty of her carriage
gained by her unconsciousness of it.</p>

<p>Having pulled the bell-cord she came
back, smiling, calmly expectant, looking
from Austen to the child, who, seated now on
the edge of a chair, was regarding her with
grave eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has a strong look of Alexander,&rdquo;
said Harriet, consideringly, &ldquo;and a little
look of you&mdash;and of me. She is a Blair,
though I can see her mother, too, about the
mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child moved under the scrutiny, but
her gaze, returning the study, did not falter.</p>

<p>Harriet laughed; was it at this imperturbability?
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she decided, &ldquo;we may
consider her a Blair.&rdquo; Then to the white
maid-servant entering: &ldquo;You may order
supper, Nelly, for Mr. Blair and myself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
This is Alexina, and, I should say, tired out.
Suppose you give her a warm bath and let
her go right to bed&mdash;have you her trunk
key, Austen?&mdash;and I will send a tray up
with her supper afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, as Nelly took the key and went out,
Harriet addressed her brother. &ldquo;For, apart
from the hygienic advantages of the bath
before the supper, I confess&rdquo;&mdash;with faintly
discernible amusement&mdash;&ldquo;to a fancy for the
ceremony as a form, so to speak, emblematic
of a moral washing and a fresh start.&rdquo; She
ended with a raising of her brows as she regarded
her brother.</p>

<p>Austen Blair had no use for levity. Mild
as this was, he dismissed it curtly. &ldquo;I
would suggest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you avoid
personalities; it can but be injudicious for
any child to hear itself discussed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Harriet laughed; she was provokingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
good-humoured. &ldquo;Coming from her
nine years of life beneath Molly&rsquo;s expansive
nature, I don&rsquo;t think you need fear for what
she&rsquo;ll gather from me.&rdquo; She took the child&rsquo;s
hand and lifted her from the chair. &ldquo;Here
is Nelly, Alexina; go with her and do what
she says. Say good-night to your uncle.
Supper, Austen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dining-room being sombre, one might
have said it accorded with the master, whose
frown had not all cleared away.</p>

<p>Harriet was speaking. &ldquo;What of Molly?
Was there a scene at parting with her voluntarily
given-up offspring? For her moods,
like her tempers, used to delight in being
somewhat inconsistent and mixed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has in no way changed,&rdquo; replied
Austen. Was it this flat conciseness in all
he said that made levity irresistible to Harriet
in turn? &ldquo;My interview with her was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
confined to business. That ended, she told
me, as an afterthought, apparently, that the
coloured woman was going to remain with
her, and she supposed Alexina could manage
on the train. She also told me that her husband
had severed connection with the legation
and was going back to Paris. Alexina
was not with them at the hotel, but with her
uncle, Senator Randolph, from whose house
Molly was married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Molly&rsquo;s parting with the child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was a piece with it all, tears and relief,
just as you would have expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the husband&rsquo;s, this Mr. Garnier&rsquo;s,
attitude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was enigmatical; how far he understands
the situation I had no means of
judging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the child, though,&rdquo; said
Harriet suddenly, &ldquo;for if there is anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
of Molly in her, life according to the Blair
standard may pall, and,&rdquo; whimsically, &ldquo;her
mixture of natures be vexed within her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austen took the Blairs seriously, and at
any time he disliked the personal or the
playful. He spoke coldly. &ldquo;Having given
the child over to you from the moment of arrival,
of this initiatory tone you are taking
I shall say no more. Duties you assume you
do best your own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet arched her brows. &ldquo;You mean,
having found better results followed the
withdrawal of your oversight of me as mistress
of our house, you are going to let me
alone in this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said her brother, &ldquo;and therefore
on the subject, now or hereafter, I shall
say no more.&rdquo; And it was eminently characteristic
of him that he never did.</p>

<p>Meanwhile up-stairs the child had gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
through with the bath and the supper like
an automaton in Nelly&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said &lsquo;yes&rsquo; when I asked her anything,&rdquo;
Nelly reported later to the cook;
&ldquo;or she said &lsquo;no&rsquo;. And her lips were set
that hard she might a&rsquo;most have been Mr.
Austen&rsquo;s own child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was all Nelly saw in the little
creature she tucked into the huge, square
bedstead under the bobinet mosquito bar.
But no sooner had Nelly&rsquo;s footsteps ceased
along the hall than the child, as one throwing
off an armour of repression, rolled out of the
high bed and from under the bar, flinging
and disarranging the neat covers with passionate
fury, sobbing wildly. A bead of gas
lit the room. She pattered across the floor
to the opened trunk, and when the little
figure, stumbling over its gown, stole back
to bed, a heartrendingly battered, plaster-headed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
doll was clasped in its arms. And,
as the voices of children at play on the sidewalk
came up through the open windows,
the child, shaken with crying&mdash;the more
passionate because of long repression&mdash;was
declaring: &ldquo;Sally Ann, baby, I couldn&rsquo;t
never have given you up, not even if I was
your own truly mother, Sally Ann, I couldn&rsquo;t,
never.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>


<p>Down-stairs the evening passed as evenings
usually did when Harriet and Austen were
alone. There were not even the varyings
from parlour to front door that the heat
seemed to necessitate for the rest of the
neighbourhood. Front porches are sociable
things. The Blairs&rsquo; was the only house on
the street without one.</p>

<p>The evening passed with the brother and
sister at opposite sides of the black, marble-topped
table in the long parlour, she embroidering
on a strip of cambric with nice
skill, he quickly and deftly cutting the wrappers
and pages of papers and magazines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
accumulated in his absence. To undertake
just what he could do justice to and keep
abreast of it, was the method by which he
accomplished more than any two men, in
business, in church affairs, in civic duties,
for the man took his citizenship seriously.
Both brother and sister had been raised to
economy of time, yet sometimes she mocked
at herself for her many excellencies and
sometimes sighed, while he&mdash;</p>

<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock Harriet rolled her work together
and said good-night, ascending the
crimson-carpeted stairway with the unhurried
movement of an Olympian goddess;
that is, if an Olympian goddess could have
been so genuinely above concern about it.</p>

<p>Her room, a front one on the second floor,
had a look of spaciousness and exquisite
order. She moved about, adjusting a shade,
setting a gas-bracket at some self-imposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
angle of correctness, giving the sheets of the
opened bed a touch of adjustment.</p>

<p>It was the price paid for the free exercise
of individuality. Already, at twenty-six,
ways were becoming habits.</p>

<p>These things arranged, she passed to the
adjoining room, from to-night given to
Alexina. Turning up the gas, Harriet
glanced about at Nelly&rsquo;s disposition of
things, then moved to the bed.</p>

<p>Whatever were the emotions called forth
by the relaxed little form, softly and regularly
breathing against a battered doll, or by
the essentially babyish face with the fine,
flaxen hair damp and clinging about the
forehead, the Blairs were people to whom
restraint was second nature. Whatever
Harriet felt showed only in solicitude for the
child who had thrown aside all cover. But
as she drew the sheet and light blanket up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
her hand touched the smoothness of a bared
little limb. It brought embarrassment. She
had but once before touched the bareness of
another&rsquo;s body, and that her mother&rsquo;s, and
in death.</p>

<p>Was it shame, this surging of strange hotness
through her?</p>

<p>The refuge of a Blair was always action.
She stepped to the bay of the room and drew
the shutters against the night-wind.</p>

<p>Between the windows stood the bureau.
Harriet paused, arrested by a daguerreotype
in a velvet case open upon it. The
child must have left it there. She sat down
and laying the picture on her knee, regarded
it, her chin in her palm.</p>

<p>It was the face of the father of the sleeping
child, dead less than a year, for whom
his sister was wearing this black trailing in
folds about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
And looking on his face, she recalled another,
exquisite in pallor, with shadowy
lashes, the face of Molly, who ten months
after Alexander&rsquo;s death had married again;
who not only married but gave up her child.
Had it been the purpose of Alexander to test
her for the child&rsquo;s sake? She had been
given her third and the child the same, with
Austen as executor and guardian. In the
event of Molly marrying again, she had been
given choice. She might relinquish all right
in the remaining third and keep the child, or
by giving up the child could claim the portion.
And the estate was large. In ten
months Molly had chosen.</p>

<p>And yet, thinking of these things, Harriet
bade herself be just, chief tenet in the
Blair creed. Was she so certain Alexander
had been altogether unhappy in his marriage?
May not compensations arise out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
a man&rsquo;s own nature if he cares for the
woman? For Harriet no longer asked why
her brother had married Molly. She knew,
knew that the thing called love is stronger
than reason, than life&mdash;some even claimed,
than death. Not that she knew it of herself,
this calm, poised Harriet, but, watching,
she had seen its miracles.</p>

<p>And out of this, Alexander may have
drawn his compensation, for, stronger than
the hourly friction of his daily life, stronger
than the hurt of outraged conventionality,
thrift, and pride, stronger than the jealousy
which must have often assailed him, had
not love survived in Alexander to the end,
love that protected and concealed Molly&rsquo;s
failings from his own people?</p>

<p>Suddenly, over Harriet swept the breath
of roses coming into an open breakfast
room and she saw a stern-lipped man lift,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
enfold a child-woman to him for a moment,
and as fiercely put her from him and go
out.</p>

<p>Harriet, breathing quickly, put her brother&rsquo;s
picture back, and going to the bed, lifted
the bar and drew the sheet again over the
child. Then she stood looking down. What
manner of little creature was this child of
Alexander and Molly?</p>

<p>Glancing about to assure herself all was
in order, she put the light out, and, with
hand outstretched against the darkness,
moved to the door, when there swept over
her again the vision of Molly clinging to
Alexander, and again she felt the surrender
of the man, the fierce closing of his arms,
and again she was shaken by his passion.</p>

<p>And even after she reached her room
and sat down at her desk to the ledger of
household accounts, it came over her, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
she paused, her hand pressed to her hot
cheek.</p>

<p>But that a little creature had cried itself to
sleep in the next room she did not dream.
She would have cried herself, had she known
it, she, to whom tears came seldom and hard.
But she was a slow awakening soul, groping,
and she did not know.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>


<p>The next morning Harriet sat in Alexina&rsquo;s
room putting criss-cross initials on a pile of
unmarked little garments. It was part of
the creed that clothes be marked.</p>

<p>Presently, as the child came to her aunt&rsquo;s
knee for a completed garment, Harriet laid
a hand on the little shoulder. Demonstration
came hard and brought a flush of embarrassment
with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexina,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t mentioned
your mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child stood silent but there came a
repeated swallowing in her throat while a
slow red welled up over the little face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
Harriet had a feeling of sudden liking and
understanding. &ldquo;You would rather&mdash;you
prefer not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child nodded, but later, as if from
some fear of appearing unresponsive, she
brought an album from her trunk and spread
it open on Harriet&rsquo;s knee. She seemed a
loyal small soul to her kinsfolk, mainly her
mother&rsquo;s people, and turning the leaves went
through the enumeration.</p>

<p>At one page&mdash;&ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; applied in a baby&rsquo;s cadence to
Alexander! Daddy! It was a revelation of
that part of her brother&rsquo;s life which Harriet
had forgotten in accounting assets. &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo;
called fearlessly, with intonation unconsciously
dear and appealing. And Alexander
had been that to his child!</p>

<p>There was no picture of Molly, but there
was a torn and vacant space facing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
Alexander. Had the child removed one? She
bore resentment then? Harriet had no idea
how far a child of nine could comprehend
and feel the situation.</p>

<p>She would have been surprised at other
things a child of nine can feel. If the routine
of the house dragged dully to Alexina,
Harriet never suspected it. The personal
attention was detailed to Nelly, who divined
more&mdash;Nelly, the freckle-faced, humorous-eyed
house girl, taken from the Orphans&rsquo;
Home and trained by Harriet&rsquo;s mother. But,
then, Nelly had been orphaned herself, and
had known those first days following asylum
consignment and perhaps had not forgot.
Her sympathy expressed itself through the
impersonal, the Blair training not having
encouraged the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a be-yewtiful dress,&rdquo; said she, laying
out the clothes for her charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
Which was true; no child of Molly&rsquo;s
would have suffered for clothes, Molly loving
them too well herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And such be-yewtiful slippers,&rdquo; said
Nelly, with Alexina in her lap, pulling up
the little stocking and buttoning the strap
about the ankle.</p>

<p>Alexina&rsquo;s hand held tight to Nelly&rsquo;s hard,
firm arm, steadying herself. Perhaps she
divined the intention. &ldquo;Can I come, too,
when you go to set the table?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>But Harriet never suspected. Nor again,
that evening while she and Austen read under
the lamp, did Harriet know that Alexina,
standing at the open parlour window gazing
at the children playing on the sidewalk, was
fighting back passionate tears of an outraged
love and a baffling sense of injustice.</p>

<p>All at once a child&rsquo;s treble came in from
the pavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you come play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina turned, with backward look of
eager inquiry to her aunt, who had come behind
her to see who called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please; go if you want,&rdquo; said
Harriet good-humouredly.</p>

<p>Austen, too, glanced out. Tip-toe on the
stone curbing of the iron fence perched a
little girl, spokesman for the group of children
behind her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the child?&rdquo; he asked his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name is Carringford. She is a
grand-daughter of the old Methodist minister
who lives at the corner; secretary of his
church board, or something, isn&rsquo;t he? I&rsquo;ve
noticed two or three little Carringfords playing
in the yard as I go by, and all of them
handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austen placed them at once. The child&rsquo;s
mother was the daughter of the old minister,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
and, with husband and children, lived
in the little brown house with him. An interest
in the details of the human affairs
about him was an unexpected phase in
Austen&rsquo;s character. He liked to know
what a man was doing, his income, his
habits, his family ties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know Carringford,&rdquo; he remarked;
&ldquo;he is book-keeper for Williams, a good,
steady man. As you say, a handsome child,
exceedingly so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet watched until the little niece
joined the group outside. &ldquo;Gregarious little
creatures they seem to be,&rdquo; she remarked.
There was good-humour in her tone, but
there was no understanding.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. On Monday
it rained. Tuesday evening Alexina stood
at the parlour window as before, looking out.
The little figure looked very solitary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
&ldquo;May I go play?&rdquo; suddenly she asked.
The voice was low, there was no note even
of wistfulness, it was merely the question.
There are children who suffer silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Harriet rejoined, looking up
from her magazine. She was the last person
to restrict any one needlessly.</p>

<p>The little niece went forth. The children
had not come for her again. Perhaps they
did not want her, but, even with this fear
upon her, go she must.</p>

<p>At the gate she paused and with the big
house in its immaculate yard behind her,
gazed up and down.</p>

<p>It was a quiet street with the houses
set irregularly back from fences of varying
patterns, and the brick sidewalks were raised
and broken in places by the roots of huge
sycamores and maples along the curbs.</p>

<p>But the cropped head of Alexina turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
this way and that in vain. The street was
deserted, the stillness lonesome. She swallowed
hard. She knew where the little girl
named Emily Carringford lived, for she had
pointed out the house that first evening as
they ran past in play, so Alexina slowly
crossed the street, hoping Emily might be
at her gate.</p>

<p>But first, as she went along, came a wide
brick cottage, sitting high above a basement,
a porch across the front. She gazed
in between the pickets of the fence, for it
seemed nice in there. The ground was
mossy under the trees, and the untrimmed
bushes made bowers with their branches.
She would like to play in this yard. Her
eyes travelled on to the house. A gentleman
sat in a cane arm-chair at the foot of the
steps, smoking, and on the porch was a lady
in a white dress with ribbons. The house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
looked old and the yard looked old, and so
did the gentleman, but the lady was young;
maybe she was going to a party, for it was a
gauzy dress and the ribbons were rosy.</p>

<p>Alexina liked the cottage and the lady,
and the big, wide yard, and somehow did
not feel as lonesome as she had. She started
on to find Emily, but at that moment the
gate of the cottage swung out across her path.
How could she know that the boy upon it,
lonely, too, had planned the thing from the
moment of her starting up the street?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina, and stopped, and
looked at the boy, uncomfortably immaculate
in fresh white linen clothes, but he was
absorbed in the flight of a bird across the
rosy western sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and play,&rdquo; said the straightforward
Alexina. Companionship was what
she was in search of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
The boy, without looking at her, shook
his head, not so much as if he meant no, but
as if he did not know how to say yes.</p>

<p>Perhaps she divined this, for approaching
the gate and fingering its hasp, she
asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy, assuming a sort of passivity of
countenance as for cover to shyness, kicked
at the gate, then scowled as he twisted his
neck within the stiff circle of his round collar
with the combative air of one who wars
against starch. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody to play
with,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve all gone to the
Sunday-school picnic. I don&rsquo;t go to that
church,&rdquo; nodding in the direction of a brick
structure down the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go to the same one as my Aunt Harriet
and my uncle,&rdquo; Alexina informed him.
&ldquo;I saw you there, and your name is William.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
I heard the lady calling you that, coming
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gate which had swung in swung out
again, bringing the boy nearer this outspoken
little girl, whose unconsciousness
was putting him more at his ease. He had
seen her at church, too, but he could not
have told her so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the rest of your name&mdash;William
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a question makes a shy person very
miserable, but the interest was pleasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William Leroy,&rdquo; said the boy tersely.
Then, as if in amend for the abruptness, he
added: &ldquo;Sometimes they call it the other
way, King William, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean when you&rsquo;re pretending?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gate stopped in its jerkings. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
had been enough about the name. He was
an imperious youngster. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s William Leroy backward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girl looked mystified, but evidently
thought best to change a subject
about which the person concerned seemed
testy. &ldquo;I saw one once,&rdquo; she said sociably;
&ldquo;a real one. He was in a carriage, with
horses and soldiers, and a star on his coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One what?&rdquo; demanded the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A king, a real one, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, this princeling on the gate knew
when his own sex were guying and he
knew the remedy. He did not know this
little girl, but he would not have thought
it of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A real&mdash;what?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A real king, but they don&rsquo;t say king;
they say &lsquo;l&rsquo;empereur.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>William looked stern. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
what you mean,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;where did
you see any king?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grave eyes were not one bit abashed.
&ldquo;In Paris, where we lived,&rdquo; said the little
girl. &ldquo;There was a boy named Tommy
watching at the hotel window, too, and he
said, &lsquo;Vive le roi,&rsquo; and Marie, my bonne, she
said, &lsquo;Sh&mdash;h: l&rsquo;empereur!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect of this was unexpected, for the
boy, descending from the gate, turned a
keenly irradiated countenance upon her.
&ldquo;Do you mean Paris, my father&rsquo;s Paris,
Paris in France?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the little girl, regarding him
with some surprise, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; For he was taking
her by the hand in a masterful fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I want
you to tell father; that&rsquo;s father there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexina, friendly soul, went willingly
enough with him through the gate and up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
the wide pavement between bordering beds
of unflourishing perennials.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, father,&rdquo; William Leroy was calling
to the gentleman at the foot of the steps;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;s been in Paris, your Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman&rsquo;s ivory-tinted fingers removed
the cigar from his lips. As he turned
the western light fell on his lean, clean-shaven
face, thin-flanked beneath high
cheek-bones. From between grey brows
thick as a finger rose a Louis Philippe nose,
its Roman prominence accentuated by the
hollowness of the cheeks. The iron-grey
hair, thrown back off the face, fell, square-cut,
to the coat collar behind.</p>

<p>Never a word spoke the gentleman, only,
cigar in hand, waited, eagle-countenanced,
sphinx-like. Yet straight Alexina came to
his side, and her baby eyes, quick to dilate,
now confidingly calm, met the ones looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
out piercingly from their retreat beneath the
heavy brows, and quite as a matter of course
a little hand rested on his knee as she stood
there, and equally as naturally, his face impassive,
did the fingers of the gentleman
close upon it.</p>

<p>A silent compact, silently entered into, for
before a word was interchanged the animated
contralto of the lady came down from
above. &ldquo;Who is the little girl, son? What
is your name, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Son&rsquo;s wince was visible. He had no
knowledge of the little girl&rsquo;s name, but he
did not want to say so.</p>

<p>But she was answering for herself, looking
up at the pretty lady, dressed as though
for a party. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mary Alexina Blair,&rdquo;
she was saying, &ldquo;but my Aunt Harriet says
it&rsquo;s to be just Alexina now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the lady. There was a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
silence before she spoke again. &ldquo;It must
be Alexander Blair&rsquo;s child, Georges. Come
up, dear, and let me see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But King William, balancing himself on
the back of his father&rsquo;s chair, objected.
&ldquo;Hurry, then, mother,&rdquo; he demanded; &ldquo;we
want to play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexina had gone up the steps obediently.
The eyes of the lady were dark and
slumbrous, but in them was the slightly
helpless look of short vision. She drew the
child close for inspection.</p>

<p>The fair hair, the even brows, the clear-gazing
eyes she seemed to have expected,
but the dilation in those same wondering
eyes raised to hers, the short upper-lip, the
full under one that trembled&mdash;these the
lady did not know. &ldquo;A sensitiveness, a
warmth,&rdquo; she said, half aloud. What did
she mean? Then she raised her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
&ldquo;See, Willy Leroy, how she stands for me,
while you pull away if I so much as lay my
hand on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you look so close,&rdquo; objected Willy,
&ldquo;and you fix my hair, and you say my
collar ain&rsquo;t straight. You&rsquo;ve seen her now,
mother; you&rsquo;ve seen her close, and I want
her to come sit on the step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, then, little Mary Alexina Blair,&rdquo;
said the lady; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a little ingrate whose
mother has to barter with him for every concession
he makes her.&rdquo; And, smiling at herself,
her face alight and arch with the animation
of her smile, Charlotte Leroy sat
back in the scarlet settee and respread her
draperies as a bird its plumage, touching the
ribbons at her waist and throat, resettling
them with the air of one who takes frank
pleasure in their presence and becomingness.
This done, she viewed her hands, charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
hands heavy with costly rings, and finally,
reassured at all points, she relaxed her buoyant
figure and looked around with smiling
return to her surroundings. It was for no
party she was dressed but for her own satisfaction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Your initials spell Mab,&rdquo; King William
was telling Alexina as they sat on the step;
&ldquo;that means you&rsquo;ll be rich. Mine don&rsquo;t
spell anything. I&rsquo;m named for my grandfather
up in Woodford, William Ransome.
He&rsquo;s dead. Father&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t either&mdash;Georges
Gautier Hippolyte Leroy. His father
ran away from France because he was a
Girondist, and came to Louisville because it
was French, and father&rsquo;s been to Paris, too;
haven&rsquo;t you, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman thus adjured removed his
cigar and addressed his wife. &ldquo;It begins to
amount to garrulity. If the opposite sex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
produces this at ten, what are we to expect
later on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s voice had a note of defence
in it, as if she could not brook even humorous
criticism of the boy. It was plain where
the passionate ardour in her nature was
centred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, I&rsquo;m glad to see it,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;I was afraid it was not in him,
I was beginning to fear he was a self-sufficient
little monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her son was continuing the family history.
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s name was Charlotte Ransome;
wasn&rsquo;t it, mother? When I&rsquo;m a
man I&rsquo;m going to buy my grandfather&rsquo;s
stock farm back, and we&rsquo;ll live there; won&rsquo;t
we, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the impulsive Charlotte, veering
around, here took her husband&rsquo;s side: &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
going to&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to,&rsquo;&rdquo; she mimicked the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
boy, then began to chant derisively as in
words familiar to both:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>And if you don&rsquo;t believe me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And think I tell a lie&mdash;</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it only gave him an idea. He was not
often a host. It was going to his head.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he ordered, to whom it was not
quite clear, and tore into the house, to be
back almost at once, bearing a beribboned
guitar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, depositing it upon his
mother&rsquo;s lap; &ldquo;now, sing it for her; sing it
right, mother. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Ram of Derby.&rsquo;&rdquo;
This to Alexina, with a sudden shyness as he
found himself addressing her.</p>

<p>But she, unconscious soul, did not recognize
it, hers being an all-absorbed interest,
and, reassured, young William went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a William Ransome once,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
when he was little, sat on General Washington&rsquo;s
knee, and General Washington sang
him &lsquo;The Ram of Derby.&rsquo; Go on, mother,
sing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Charlotte, with eyes laughing down
on the two upturned faces, &ldquo;went on,&rdquo; her
jewelled fingers bringing the touch of a practised
hand upon the strings, her buoyant
figure responsive to the rhythm, while into
the Munchausen recital she threw a dash, a
swing that rendered the interest breathless.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>There was a ram of Derby</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>I&rsquo;ve often heard it said,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He was the greatest sheep, sir,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>That ever wore a head.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if you don&rsquo;t believe me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And think I tell a lie,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Just go down to Derby</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And see as well as I.</i><br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>The horns upon this ram, sir,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>They reached up to the sky,</i><br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The eagles built their nest there,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>For I heard the young ones cry.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if you don&rsquo;t believe me, etc., etc.</i><br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>The wool upon this ram, sir,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>It grew down to the ground,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The devil cut it off, sir,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To make a morning gown.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if you don&rsquo;t believe me, etc., etc.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so on through the tale. King William,
at her knees, clapped his hands. Alexina,
by him, clapped hers, too, for joy of companionship,
while the third listener sat with
unchanging countenance below. But he
liked it, somehow one knew he liked it, knew
that he was listening down there in the dusk.</p>

<p>Perhaps Charlotte knew it, too. The vibrant
twang slowed to richer chords, broke
into rippling chromatic, caught a new measure,
a minor note, and her contralto began:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>I am going far away, far away to leave you now,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>To the Mississippi River I am going&mdash;</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
But this was only so much suggestion for
her son&rsquo;s active brain. &ldquo;Tell her, mother,&rdquo;
he begged, pulling at Charlotte&rsquo;s sleeve;
&ldquo;tell her about the &lsquo;King William.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it has lain dormant, this egotism,
unsuspected,&rdquo; came up from out of the dusk.</p>

<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s fingers swept the chords, her
eyes fixed adoringly on her little son&rsquo;s face,
the while she sang on, absently, softly:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>Down in my ol&rsquo; cabin home,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>There lies my sister an&rsquo; my brother.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There lies my wife, the joy of my life,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>An&rsquo; the child in the grave with its mother.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But King William, far from being harrowed
by the woeful enumeration, laid an
imperious hand on the strings. &ldquo;Tell her,
mother; I want you to tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come then, and kiss mother, and I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved the intervening step and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
submitted a cheek reluctantly. &ldquo;Just one and
you said you&rsquo;d tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Charlotte, imperious herself, waved
him off; she&rsquo;d none of him now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
because he&rsquo;s a vain boy, little Mary Alexina
Blair, and filled with self-importance, that
he wants you to know, and he only wants
me to tell you because he has not quite the
assurance to do it himself; that is why
he wants me to tell about the great, white-prowed
Argo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We call them bows, not prows,&rdquo; came up
out of the dusk.</p>

<p>But she refused the correction. &ldquo;&mdash;The
white-prowed Argo that is building across
the river, to go in search of a golden fleece
for little Jason here, a boat large, oh larger
even than those other boats of little Jason&rsquo;s
father, the Captain down there, which used
to float up and down the Mississippi, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
which vanished one day into the maw of the
Confederacy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jason was lifting his voice. &ldquo;Not
that way; make her stop, father; that ain&rsquo;t
the way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But mother was not to be hurried out of
her revenge. &ldquo;And this big, white ark is one
day going to float off on the flood of Hope,
bearing Jason and his father and his mother,
the last plank of fortune between them
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jason was beating with his hands on the
steps. &ldquo;Make her stop, father; make her
tell it right; she don&rsquo;t understand what
mother means. Do you?&rdquo; with an appeal
to the absorbed Alexina.</p>

<p>That small soul jumped and looked embarrassed
to know what to say, for direct
admissions are not always polite. &ldquo;I had
an ark once,&rdquo; she stated, &ldquo;but I sucked the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
red off Noah, and Marie, my bonne, took it
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning down, Charlotte Leroy swept the
baby-voiced creature up into her lap. There
was a passion of maternity in the act. &ldquo;You
innocent,&rdquo; she said, and held her fast.</p>

<p>It was nice to be there; the ribbons and
the lacy ruffles were soft beneath her cheek,
and the dark eyes of the lady were smiling
down.</p>

<p>The child turned suddenly and clung to
Charlotte with passionate responsiveness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the boat his father is building,
Willy wants you to know, little Mab,&rdquo; the
lady was telling her, &ldquo;and how, the other
day, the Captain down there and our friends
and Willy and I went aboard her, on the
ways at the shipyard over the river, and how,
at the ax-stroke, as she slid down and out
across the water, Willy broke the bottle on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
the bow and christened the boat &lsquo;King
William.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; came up in the Captain&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>The moon was rising slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some one at the gate,&rdquo; cried
Willy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for me,&rdquo; said Alexina, starting up;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s Nelly and she&rsquo;s hunting me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, Nelly, leading her across the street,
was saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Miss Harriet is
going to like it when she knows where you&rsquo;ve
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nelly couldn&rsquo;t say; &ldquo;except that
they&rsquo;re the only ladies on the street not
knowing each other,&rdquo; she explained.</p>

<p>The two went in. Alexina dropped Nelly&rsquo;s
hand and walked into the parlour and
across to Harriet&rsquo;s knee. Austen sat reading
on the other side of the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over to a boy&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said
Alexina; &ldquo;his name is King William and
their other name is Leroy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet held the cambric strip of embroidery
from her and viewed it. &ldquo;Austen,&rdquo;
she asked, &ldquo;is Alexina to play indiscriminately
with the children on the square?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austen looked across at his sister. &ldquo;It
is within your authority to decide,&rdquo; he returned,
&ldquo;but I know of no reason why she
should not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet made no response. Outwardly
she was concerned with some directions to
Nelly, waiting to take the child to bed, but
inwardly she was wondering if Austen ever
could have cared for this Charlotte Ransome.</p>

<p>He sat long after Harriet had gone. Then,
rising abruptly, he went out the front door
and walked to the corner of the house. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
was dark in the coachman&rsquo;s room above
the stable, and the master could go to bed
secure that his oil was not being wasted.</p>

<p>That was all, yet he did not go in. The
night was perfect, full of moonlight and the
scent of earth and growing things. It was
so still the houses along the street seemed
asleep.</p>

<p>Almost furtively, the gaze of Austen lifted
to the cottage, dark and silent across the
way. He had been the one who would not
forgive; the other had been only an impetuous
girl.</p>

<p>He stood there long. Perhaps his face
was colder, his lips pressed to a thinner line;
perhaps it was the moonlight. Then he
turned and went into the house.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX</h3>


<p>Alexina came to Harriet with information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily goes to school to her aunt, and
King William goes there, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; returned Harriet. Her interest
was good-humoured rather than ardent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go, too,&rdquo; said her niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; from Harriet, understanding at
last; &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t school about over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two weeks more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it will make you happy, why not, if the
teacher does not object?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Alexina went with Emily to school.
King William was there, but he hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
noticed her, seeming gloomy and given to
taking his slate off into corners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t want to come,&rdquo; explained
Emily; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the only boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what does he come for?&rdquo; queried
the practical Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother won&rsquo;t let him go to a public
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was more to be learned about William.
He fought the boys who went to the
public school, because they jeered him in his
ignominy. Alexina saw it happening up
the alley but, strangely enough, when William
appeared at school, he seemed cheered
up, though something of a wreck.</p>

<p>Out of school, Alexina often went over to
Emily&rsquo;s house to play. There were no servants
there, but her mamma beat up things
in crocks, and her great-aunty, a brisk little
old woman with sharp eyes, made yeast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
cakes and dried them out under the arbour
and milked the cow, too, and Emily&rsquo;s little
brother, Oliver, carried milk to the neighbours.
Once in the spotless, shining kitchen,
Alexina was allowed to wield a mop in a
dish-pan and, still again, to stir at batter in
a bowl.</p>

<p>In the room which would have been the
parlour in another house, Emily&rsquo;s grandfather
Pryor sat at a table with books
around him, and wrote on big sheets of paper
in close writing. He was a stern old man
and his hair stood out fine and white about
his head. Once, as he passed across the
front porch, he looked at Emily, then stopped,
pointing to the chain about her neck.
It was Alexina&rsquo;s little gold necklace which
Emily had begged to wear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it off,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Emily obeyed, but her checks were flaming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
and when he had gone she threw her
head back. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m grown, I mean to
have them of my own, and wear them, too,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>She seemed happier away from home.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over to your house,&rdquo; she always
said. She liked grown people, too, and
Uncle Austen once patted her head, and
after she had gone said to Aunt Harriet:
&ldquo;A handsome child, an unusually pleasing
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while Alexina played thus with
Emily, more often she trudged across to
King William&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The nature of engrossment was different
over there. Often as not it was theology,
though this, to be sure, was the Captain&rsquo;s
word for it, not his son&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Willy&rsquo;s mother, like Aunt Harriet, was a
Presbyterian. &ldquo;If I had been a better one,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
she lamented to her husband one evening,
&ldquo;I would know how to meet his questions
now. You don&rsquo;t take one bit of the responsibility
of his religious training, Captain
Leroy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creed of King William&rsquo;s mamma,
when she came to formulate it, seemed a
stern one, and it lost nothing in its setting
forth by reason of her determination to do
her duty by her son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven I had to sit under these
things when I was a child, however I hated
it then, or I could not do my part by him
now,&rdquo; she told the Captain. &ldquo;I want him,&rdquo;
fervently, &ldquo;to be everything I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which might,&rdquo; suggested the Captain,
&ldquo;be a prig, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But King William, listening, drank in
these things. He had a garden patch in the
back yard and knew the nature and habits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
of every vegetable in it, and being strictly a
utilitarian, he weeded out sickly plants and
unknown cotyledons with a ruthless hand.</p>

<p>Alexina expostulated. &ldquo;Maybe it hurts
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; she feared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it does,&rdquo; said the inexorable
William; &ldquo;but they are like the souls born
to be damned. Put &rsquo;em on the brush pile
there, and after a while we&rsquo;ll burn &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At other times the yard was a sea-girt
coral reef and they the stranded mariners.
Generally Alexina accepted everything. The
stories were new to her. But when she did
have knowledge of a thing she stood firm;
for instance, about the ocean, that you could
not land every few moments of your progress
and throw out gang-planks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For I&rsquo;ve been there,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;and
you couldn&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At times they adjourned to the commons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
behind the stable, which, in reality, were
plains frequented by Indians, or, if the yard
palled or rain drove them in, there was
fat, black, plausible Aunt Rose in the basement
kitchen to talk to, and if Aunt Rose
proved fractious and drove them out, together
with her own brood generally skulking
around, before a threatening dish-rag or
broom, there was Charlotte to be beguiled
from more serious occupation into doing her
son&rsquo;s bidding.</p>

<p>Charlotte was always busy. The cottage
and all in it had come to her from her
father&rsquo;s aunt. She had been accustomed
to seeing the windows, the furniture, the mirrors,
the silver door knobs shining; therefore,
she knew such things ought to shine,
and since there was no one in these days but
herself to do it, she cleaned, polished, rubbed,
and went to bed limp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
One afternoon in the late fall, when the
children sought her, she was pasting papers
over glasses of jelly. &ldquo;We went over the
river to see the boat yesterday,&rdquo; King William
was saying to Alexina as they came in.
&ldquo;Tell her about it, mother; about the gold
star at the bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The papers did not want to stick. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a bad boy, little Mab,&rdquo; Charlotte informed
her. &ldquo;He made me take him over before
he&rsquo;d promise to go to the party he&rsquo;s asked
to. He wants to be a little boor who won&rsquo;t
know how to act when he grows up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never goin&rsquo; to parties when I&rsquo;m
grown up, so what&rsquo;s the use learning how
to act at &rsquo;em now?&rdquo; argued her son.</p>

<p>Charlotte dropped a mucilaged paper.
&ldquo;But you promised,&rdquo; she reminded him
anxiously; &ldquo;you promised&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;&rdquo; admitted her son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
Charlotte kept a fire in her parlour. Coal
was at a fabulous price in the South that
winter, but she had never known a parlour
without a fire, and here she and the children
sat in the afternoons, the Captain often
returning early and joining them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Georges,&rdquo; said Charlotte upon one of
these occasions, &ldquo;we are poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain smoked in silence. Perhaps
he had realized it before. His keen eyes,
however, were regarding her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Charlotte, &ldquo;we go on acting
as though we were rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When your trousers get shabby, you
order more like them. Did you ever ask
your tailor if he has anything cheaper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, trousers of that pearl tint peculiar
to the finest fabrics were as characteristic a
part of the Captain&rsquo;s garb as were the black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
coat, the low-cut vest, the linen cambric
handkerchiefs like small tablecloths for size,
the tall silk hat, and the Henry Clay collar
above the black silk stock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever ask him if he had anything
cheaper, Georges?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; admitted Georges, &ldquo;that I
ever did.&rdquo; For the Captain had never asked
his tailor a price in his life. When the bill
came he paid it. But it takes income to
meet eccentricities of this sort, while now&mdash;</p>

<p>Did the Captain, glancing from his wife
to the boy on the floor, seem to age, to
shrink in his chair? For Charlotte was
thirty-two and the boy was ten and the Captain
was nearing sixty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when your shirts and Willy&rsquo;s things
and mine give out, I&rsquo;ve been going right on
to the sisters ordering more. Convent
prices are high, Georges.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
The Captain had nothing to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adele has been telling me that she cuts
down her eldest boy&rsquo;s things for the little
one.&rdquo; Adele was the widow of a Confederate
general. &ldquo;So I borrowed her patterns.
Listening to Adele talk, I realized,
Georges, that you and Willy and I have to
learn how to be poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this point that Charlotte brought
forth from the chair behind her a voluminous
broadcloth cape, such as men then
wore for outer wrap, and spread it on the
mahogany centre-table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly good, if you did discard it,
and I&rsquo;m going to cut it into something for
Willy; I didn&rsquo;t tell Adele I never had tried,
she is so capable, but I borrowed her patterns.&rdquo;
And Charlotte brought forth a
paper roll.</p>

<p>The Captain, in the arm-chair, sat and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
watched. Alexina, from his knee, where he
had a way of lifting her, watched too.
Willy, from a perch on the arm of the sofa,
offered suggestions.</p>

<p>This was early in the afternoon. At six
o&rsquo;clock the Captain, lighting another of an
uninterrupted series of cigars, was still
watching silently. On the sofa sat Charlotte,
in tears. On the table, tailor fashion,
sat King William, sorting patterns, while
Nelly, who had come for Alexina, stood by
and directed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does he know?&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy,
watching her son a little anxiously, asked
the Captain. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like him to develop
such a bent. He doesn&rsquo;t get it from
you&mdash;or from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look at my legs,&rdquo; said William, &ldquo;and
then I build it that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another afternoon the Captain looked up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
from his smoking and spoke to Charlotte.
The children were on the floor turning the
pages of a picture paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have succeeded in securing the loan
on a mortgage on the boat. Cowan arranged
it through his bank. It was at a
higher rate than we had agreed on, but we&rsquo;d
lost all the time we could spare. We&rsquo;ll push
ahead now and have things finished by
spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, over at the Blairs&rsquo;, as Alexina
climbed into her place at the table Austen
was speaking to Harriet. &ldquo;You remember
I told you I was looking for an investment
of the proceeds of those bonds of Alexina&rsquo;s
which matured the other day? This morning
I took a mortgage on a boat Cowan is
building at his yard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina heard her name, but did not understand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>


<p>There came a day the following spring when
Alexina, seeking her aunt, wept.</p>

<p>Harriet gazed at her dismayed, at a loss.
Heretofore Alexina had taken her tears to
Nelly or had kept them to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are going away,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;King
William and them; going in the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, as a matter to cry about, was a
mystery to Harriet. &ldquo;Going where?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To get the golden fleece,&rdquo; her weeping
niece assured her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Harriet amused, &ldquo;let us
hope they may find it, but why the tears?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
Alexina got up and carried her tears to
her own room. It spoke her infantile capacity
to discriminate that she bore away no
resentment; there are things that the Aunt
Harriets with the best wills in the world
need not be expected to understand.</p>

<p>King William&rsquo;s mother, telling her, had
held her tight and rocked her; King William&rsquo;s
father, when he saw her lip trembling
afterward, had lifted her on his knee.</p>

<p>Going into the big, high room which was
her own, Alexina shut the door. Then she
cast herself on the floor. A little hand, beating
about wildly, came upon Sally Ann, lying
unregarded there. Gathering her in fiercely,
presently the sobs grew quieter. Later she
wiped her eyes upon her child and, kissing
her tenderly, put her down and went over
to King William&rsquo;s; the time was short and
she could have Sally Ann afterward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
The next day the cottage was closed and
the shutters made fast. Alexina felt lonesome
even to look over there, and Sally Anns
are but silent comforters.</p>

<p>But in a year the Leroys came back from
St. Louis, between which city and New
Orleans the splendid new &ldquo;King William&rdquo;
had been plying. The judgment of Captain
Leroy had been at fault, which is a sad
thing when a man is sixty. The day of the
steamboat had passed, because that of the
railroad had come. The &ldquo;King William&rdquo;
as a venture was a failure.</p>

<p>So, one morning, the cottage windows
were open to the Virginia creeper outside
them. Nelly whispered the news to Alexina
at breakfast, and the child could not eat
for hurry to be through and go over.</p>

<p>It was as if King William had been watching
for her, for he came running to the gate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
and took her hand to conduct her in. He
was taller and thinner, and looked different,
and neither could find anything to say on the
way.</p>

<p>Charlotte was sitting in the parlour, her
wraps half-removed. They had only just
arrived, and the stillness and closeness of
a newly opened house was about. &ldquo;How
does one pack furniture for moving, Willy?&rdquo;
Charlotte began as he appeared.</p>

<p>But he was bringing Alexina. &ldquo;Tell her
about it, mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so she&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte, brightening, held out her arms.
Then, having lifted the child to her lap and
kissed her, her face grew wan again. &ldquo;There
was no fleece for Jason, little Mab; there is
no Land of Colchis, never believe it. And
those seeking, like Willy and me, are like to
wander until youth and hope and opportunity
are gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
She was crying against a little cropped
head. King William stood irresolute, then
put an arm around her. &ldquo;Not that way,
mummy; don&rsquo;t tell it that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But control had given way. &ldquo;And there
is nothing for little Jason. He must go and
fight with his bare hands like any poor
churl&rsquo;s child&mdash;oh, Willy, Willy, my little
son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina, in her lap, sat very still; King
William was staring hard into space.</p>

<p>Charlotte went on. &ldquo;We are going away,
little Mab, Willy and his father and I; going
away for good. Everything that ever was
ours, this cottage and all, is gone. We are
going to a place in the South called Aden,
where there are a few acres that still are ours
only because they would not sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment they all were still. Then the
little breast of Alexina began to heave. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
Leroys had never seen her this way. Sally
Ann had, many times, and Nelly once or
twice. She threw herself upon Charlotte.
&ldquo;I want to go, too; I want to go; I hate it&mdash;there,&rdquo;
with a motion of self toward the big,
white house visible through the window.
&ldquo;I hate it, and I want to go too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were all crying now. Suddenly
King William stood forth in front of the
child. &ldquo;When we get rich, I&rsquo;ll come for
you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The practical Alexina looked through the
arrested tears as she sat up. &ldquo;But if you
don&rsquo;t get rich?&rdquo; she questioned.</p>

<p>Charlotte laughed. She was half child
herself. The laugh died. The other half
was woman. &ldquo;Then he won&rsquo;t come; if he
is the son of his father, he won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="padtop">CHAPTER ONE</h3>


<p>Alexina Blair, at twenty, returned from
school to her uncle&rsquo;s home with but small
emotion, as, at fourteen, she had left with
little regret, yet the shady streets, the open
front doors, the welcomes called from up-stairs
windows as she passed&mdash;evidences
that she was back among her own people
in the South&mdash;all at once made her glad to
be here.</p>

<p>How could she have felt emotion over a
mere return to Uncle Austen&rsquo;s house? She
might have felt enthusiasm over Nelly, but
Nelly was married to the gardener at her old
asylum and a Katy had taken her place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
The house was the same. If only its stone
fa&ccedil;ade might be allowed to mellow, to grey
a little! But, newly cleaned, it stood coldly
immaculate in its yard of shaven lawn set
about with clipped shrubberies. As for her
uncle, Alexina found herself applying the
same adjectives to him, shaven, immaculate,
cold.</p>

<p>She wondered what he thought of her, but
Uncle Austen never made personal remarks.</p>

<p>Aunt Harriet, on joining her niece in the
East early in the summer, had looked at her
consideringly. She seemed pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Alexina, you are a
Tennyson young person, tall and most divinely&mdash;you
are a little more intense in
your colouring than is usual with a Blair.
I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The somewhat doubtful smile on the
girl&rsquo;s face deepened as if a sudden radiance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
leaped into it. She seized her aunt&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very nice, Aunt
Harriet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet laughed, rather pleased than not,
but she still was studying the girl. &ldquo;She
is impulsive and she doesn&rsquo;t look set,&rdquo;
the aunt was telling herself&mdash;was it gratefully?
&ldquo;perhaps she is less Blair than I
thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austen Blair too, in fact, now viewed his
niece with complacency&mdash;she fulfilled the
Blair requirements&mdash;but he talked of other
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the intention of your aunt and myself,&rdquo;
he told her promptly, &ldquo;to introduce
you at once to what will be your social
world, for it is well for everyone to have
local attachment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the matter progressed it appeared that
social introduction, as Uncle Austen understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
it, was largely a matter of expenditure.
In all investment it is the expected thing to
place where there is likeliest return. Therefore
he scanned the invitation list earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can afford to do the thing as it
should be done,&rdquo; he remarked to Harriet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She? But Austen&mdash;&rdquo; Harriet hesitated.
&ldquo;I supposed it was ours, this affair;
it seems the least&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austen looked at her. At first he did not
comprehend, then he replied with some asperity.
&ldquo;I have so far kept sentiment and
business apart in managing Alexina&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet was silenced. It was becoming
less and less wise to oppose Austen. He
had his own ideas about the matter. &ldquo;The
thing is to be done handsomely,&rdquo; he set
forth, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; as qualification, &ldquo;judiciously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore he stopped an acquaintance on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
the street a day or two before the affair.
&ldquo;Are we to have the pleasure of seeing you
on Tuesday?&rdquo; he asked, even a little ostentatiously,
for the young man had neglected
to accept or decline.</p>

<p>Austen reported the result to Harriet.
&ldquo;For there is no use ordering a supper for
five hundred if but four hundred and ninety-nine
are coming,&rdquo; he told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said her brother.</p>

<p>Alexina, present at the conversation,
looked from the one to the other. Uncle
Austen was Uncle Austen; there was a
slight lift of the girlish shoulders as she admitted
this. But Aunt Harriet&mdash;</p>

<p>For Harriet had changed. She had been
changing these past two summers. She
was absent, forgetful, absorbed, even irritable.
Aunt Harriet! And recalled, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
would colour and look about in startled
fashion.</p>

<p>Alexina and Harriet had been always on
terms friendly and pleasant, but scarcely to
be called intimate; terms that, after a cordial
good-night, closed the door between their
rooms, and while the girl had been conscious
of a fondness for her serene and capable
aunt, there were times too, when, met by
that same serenity, she had felt she must
rebel, and in secret had thrown her young
arms out in impotent, passionate protest.</p>

<p>But now Aunt Harriet forgot and neglected
and grew cross like any one, and the sententious
utterances of Uncle Austen irritated
her. Alexina, going into her room one day,
found her with her head bowed on the desk.
Was she crying? The girl slipped out.</p>

<p>Was Aunt Harriet unhappy? The heart
of Alexina warmed to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
The evening of Alexina&rsquo;s return home
Harriet had come to her door. To twenty
years thirty-eight seems pitiably far along
in life, yet Harriet called up no such feeling
in Alexina. No passion of living writ itself
on Galatea&rsquo;s check while she was in marble,
and Alexina, opening the door to the tap,
thought her aunt beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there are callers to-night,&rdquo; Harriet
said, &ldquo;I want you to come down. My
friends are not too elderly,&rdquo; she smiled in
the old, good-humoured way, &ldquo;to be nice to
you this winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So later Alexina went down to the library,
a room long unfurnished, now the only
really cheerful room in the house. Was it
because Harriet had furnished it?</p>

<p>The girl always had realized in an indefinite
way that Harriet was a personage;
later, in their summers away together, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
discovered that men liked her handsome
aunt.</p>

<p>In the library she found a group who,
from the conversation, seemed to be accustomed
to dropping in thus in casual fashion.
They were men of capacity and presence,
one felt that, even in the case of that long
avowed person of fashion, Mr. Marriot
Bland, who was getting dangerously near to
that time of life when he would be designated
an old beau. He was a personage, too,
of his type. Alexina shook hands with him
gaily; she had been used to his coming
since she first came to live with Aunt Harriet
and Uncle Austen. Harriet introduced
the others. The girl&rsquo;s spirits rose; she felt
it was nice that she should be knowing
them.</p>

<p>And they? What does middle-age feel,
looking upon youth, eager-eyed, buoyant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
flushed with the first glow from that unknown
about to dawn?</p>

<p>Oh, it was a charming evening. The girl
showed she thought it so and smiled, and
the men smiled too, as they joined Harriet
in making her the young centre. Perhaps
there was a tender something in the smiles.
Was it for their own gone youth?</p>

<p>One, a Major Rathbone, stayed after the
others left. He sat building little breastworks
on the centre-table out of matches
taken from the bronze stand by the lamp,
and as he talked he looked over every now
and then at Harriet on the other side.</p>

<p>In the soberer reaction following the
breaking up of the group, Alexina, too,
found time to look at Harriet. It was an
Aunt Harriet that she had never seen before.
The colour was richly dyeing this Harriet&rsquo;s
cheeks, and the jewel pendant at her throat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
rose and trembled and fell, and her white
lids fell, too, though she had laughed when
her eyes met laughter and something else in
the brown eyes of the Major fixed on her.</p>

<p>It was of Mr. Marriot Bland the Major
was speaking, his smooth, brown hand caressing
his clean-shaven chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So cruelly confident are you cold Dianas,&rdquo;
he was saying. &ldquo;Now, even a Penelope
must hold out the lure of her web to an
old suitor, but you Dianas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina laughed. She had jumped
promptly into a liking for this lean, brown
man with the keen, humorous eyes and the
deliberate yet quick movements, and now
absorbed in her thoughts, was unconscious
of her steadfast gaze fixed on him, until he
suddenly brought his eyes to bear on hers
with humorous inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
Now Alexina, being fair, showed blushes
most embarrassingly, but she could laugh
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the conclusion?&rdquo; he demanded;
&ldquo;or would it be wiser not to press inquiry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina laughed again. She knew she
liked this Major.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;You
are so different from what I expected. I
heard Aunt Harriet and Uncle Austen discussing
one of your editorials, so I read it.
I thought you would be different&mdash;fiercer
maybe, and&mdash;er&mdash;more aggressive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina began to blush again, for the
Major was so edified at something that his
enjoyment was suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no man is expected to live down to
his editorials, Miss Alexina; I write &rsquo;em for
a living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stroked his chin as he regarded her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
but there was laughter too out of the tail of
his eye across at Aunt Harriet, who was
laughing also, though she looked teased.</p>

<p>Later Alexina learned more about this
Major Rathbone. It was Emily Carringford
who told her. Emily came over
promptly the day after Alexina&rsquo;s return and,
admitted by Katy, ran up as of old.</p>

<p>Alexina, hearing her name called, turned
from a mel&eacute;e of unpacking as the other
reached the open doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Emily,&rdquo; she said, and stood and
gazed.</p>

<p>Emily stood, too, archly, and, meeting
Alexina&rsquo;s look, laughed. Her blush was an
acknowledgment; she did not even pretend
to misunderstand Alexina&rsquo;s meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Harriet told me how&mdash;how lovely
you were, and Uncle Austen told me last
night that my friend, Miss Emily, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
considered an &lsquo;unusually good-looking woman&mdash;a
handsome woman, in fact.&rsquo;&rdquo; The
niece had her uncle&rsquo;s every conciseness of
tone as she quoted. &ldquo;But somehow with it
all, I wasn&rsquo;t prepared&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came forward with hands out.</p>

<p>Emily forgot to take the hands. &ldquo;Did he
say that, really, Alexina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; why shouldn&rsquo;t he? Oh, Emily,
it must be joy, or does it frighten you to
know you&rsquo;re so beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was letting her fingers touch, almost
with awe, the curve of the other&rsquo;s check.</p>

<p>Emily laughed, but the crimson on the
cheek deepened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your voice?&rdquo; demanded Alexina.
&ldquo;I want to hear you sing. Did you get the
place in the choir you wrote me about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Harriet got it for me; it was she
who suggested it&mdash;that is, she got Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
Blair to get it for me. It&rsquo;s at your church,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Austen? No. Did he, really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the surprise in Alexina&rsquo;s voice was
unfair to her uncle. To help people to the
helping of themselves was part of his creed.
He looked upon it as a furthering of the general
social economy, as indeed he had pointed
out more than once to those he was thus
assisting.</p>

<p>But Alexina had many things to ask.
She pushed Emily into a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it pleasant&mdash;the choir?&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasant? Well,&rdquo; Emily looked away
and coloured, &ldquo;I like the money; I&rsquo;ve never
been able to have any clothes before. There
was a scene at home about it&mdash;my singing,
I mean, in any but my own church, and for
money. It was grandfather, of course; it&rsquo;s
always been grandfather. He says it&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
spiritual prostitution, whatever he means
by that, taking money for praising the Lord
in an alien faith.&rdquo; She laughed in an
off-hand way. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be honest, I&rsquo;d
have to be sooner or later with you, anyhow,
I hate it&mdash;not the work and rehearsals
so much, but the being patronized.
When some of those women stop me, with
the air of doing the gracious thing, to tell
me they have enjoyed my singing, oh, I
could&mdash;&rdquo; Again she laughed, but her
cheeks were blazing. Then she leaned over
and fingered some of the girlish fineries
strewing the bed. &ldquo;I hate it at home,
too, when it comes to being honest about
things&mdash;six of us, with grandfather and
Aunt Carrie making eight, in that little
house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, Alexina chanced to refer to Major
Rathbone. She spoke enthusiastically, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
she either liked people or she did not like
them. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you heard about him?&rdquo;
asked Emily in surprise. &ldquo;He met Miss
Harriet two years ago, and he&rsquo;s been coming
ever since. It&rsquo;s funny, too, that he should.
He&rsquo;s <em>the</em> Major Rathbone, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexina looked unenlightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Emily, &ldquo;the Major Rathbone
who was the Confederate guerrilla&mdash;the
one who captured and burned a train-load
of stuff your grandfather and Mr. Austen
had contracted to deliver for the government.
I&rsquo;ve heard people tell about it a dozen
different ways since he&rsquo;s been coming to
see Miss Harriet. Anyway, however it was,
the government at the time put a price on
his head and your grandfather and Mr.
Austen doubled it. And now they say he&rsquo;s
in love with Miss Harriet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In love! With Aunt Harriet! Alexina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
grew hot. Aunt Harriet! She felt strange
and queer. But Emily was saying more.
&ldquo;Mr. Blair and Major Rathbone aren&rsquo;t
friends even yet; I was here to supper with
Miss Harriet one evening last winter, and
Mr. Blair was furious over an editorial by
Major Rathbone in the paper that day about
some political appointments from Washington.
Mr. Blair had had something to do
with them, had been consulted about them
from Washington, it seems. Major Rathbone&rsquo;s
a Catholic, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It rushed upon Alexina that she had
spoken to the Major of a family discussion
over his editorials.</p>

<p>Emily stayed until dusk. As Alexina
went down to the door with her, they met
Uncle Austen just coming in. He stopped,
shook hands, and asked how matters were
in the choir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
As Emily ran down the steps he addressed
himself to his niece. &ldquo;A praiseworthy
young girl to have gone so practically to
work.&rdquo; Then as Emily at the gate looked
back, nodding archly, he repeated it. &ldquo;A
praiseworthy young girl, praiseworthy and
sensible,&rdquo; his gaze following her, &ldquo;as well as
handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went in, but Alexina lingered on the
broad stone steps. It was October and the
twilight was purple and hazy. Chrysanthemums
bloomed against the background
of the shrubbery; the maples along the
street were drifting leaves upon the sidewalk;
the sycamores stood with their shed
foliage like a cast garment about their
feet, raising giant white limbs naked to
heaven.</p>

<p>There were lights in the wide brick cottage.
Strangers lived there now. A swinging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
sign above the gate set forth that a Doctor
Ransome dwelt therein.</p>

<p>The eddying fall of leaves is depressing.
Autumn anyhow is a melancholy time. Alexina,
going in, closed the door.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>


<p>The Blair reception to introduce their niece
may have been to others the usual matter
of lights and flowers and music, but to
the niece it was different, for it was her
affair.</p>

<p>She and her aunt went down together.
The stairway was broad, and to-night its
banister trailed roses.</p>

<p>Alexina was radiant. She even marched
up and kissed her uncle. Things felt actually
festive.</p>

<p>All the little social world was there that
evening. Alexina recalled many of the girls
and the older women; of the older men she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
knew a few, but of the younger only one
could she remember as knowing.</p>

<p>He was a rosy-cheeked youth with vigorous,
curling yellow hair, and he came up to
her with a hearty swinging of the body, smiling
in a friendly and expectant way, showing
nice, square teeth, boyishly far apart.
She knew him at once; he had gone to
dancing school when she did, and she was
glad to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Georgy,&rdquo; she said, and held out a
hand, just as it was borne in upon her that
Georgy wore a young down on his lip and
was a man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, blushing, &ldquo;I hope you
don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was blushing, too, but the smile that
showed his nice spaced teeth was honest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which Alexina felt was good of him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
so she smiled back and chatted and tried to
make it up. And Georgy lingered and continued
to linger and to blush beneath his already
ruddy skin until Harriet, turning,
sent him away, for Harriet was a woman of
the world and Georgy was the rich and only
child of the richest mamma present, and the
other mammas were watching.</p>

<p>Alexina&rsquo;s eyes followed him as he went,
then wandered across the long room to Emily.
She had expected to feel a sense of responsibility
about Emily, but Uncle Austen,
after a long and precise survey of her from
across the room, put his eye-glasses into
their case and went to her. His prim air of
unbending for the festive occasion was almost
comical as he brought up youths to
make them known. This done he fell back
to his general duties as host.</p>

<p>But Alexina, watching Emily, felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
dissatisfaction with her, her archness was overdone,
her laughter was anxious.</p>

<p>Why should Emily stoop to strive so?
With her milk-white skin and chestnut hair,
with her red lips and starry eyes there
should have belonged to her a pride and a
young dignity. Alexina, youthfully stern,
turned away.</p>

<p>It brought her back to the amusing things
of earth, however, that Uncle Austen should
take Emily home when it was over. Would
Emily be arch with Uncle Austen? Picture
it!</p>

<p>Several of the older men lingered after the
other guests were gone, and they, with Harriet
and Alexina, had coffee in the library.
The orderliness of the room, compared with
the dishevelled appearance elsewhere now
the occasion was over, seemed cheerful, and
these men friends of Aunt Harriet were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
interesting. The talk was personal, as among
intimates. The local morning paper, opposed
to Major Rathbone&rsquo;s own, it seemed,
had taxed the Major with aspiring to be the
next nominee of his party for Congress.
And this was proving occasion for much
banter at his expense by the other men, for
the truth was the Major <em>was</em> being considered
as a possibility, but a possibility tempered,
for one thing, by the fact that his
guerrilla past shed a somewhat lurid light
upon his exemplary present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why want to keep it secret as if it
were something dark and plotting?&rdquo; insisted
Harriet Blair. &ldquo;Why not come right
out and admit your willingness if your party
wants you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men laughed in varying degrees of
delight at this feminine perspicacity. The
Major regarded her with somewhat comical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
humour, looking a little shamefaced, though
he was laughing too. &ldquo;For the fear my
party can&rsquo;t afford to have me,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;It takes money. They are casting about
for a richer available man first, and, that
failing, why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Austen Blair came in, bringing a
breath of the November chill. Or was it his
own personality that brought the chill,
Alexina wondered. For, to do him justice,
there was a distinction, a fine coldness, a
bearing about him which distinguished him
in any company.</p>

<p>Promptly on his coming the group broke
up. The others passed into the hall to hunt
overcoats, but the Major paused to address
Harriet, who had risen and was looking at
him as he spoke. There was colour in her
face, and light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friday evening, then,&rdquo; he was saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
&ldquo;you will go with me to hear Benton lecture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Austen, who had taken a cup of coffee
from Alexina, looked up sharply. He put
the cup down.</p>

<p>Harriet smiled acquiescence. &ldquo;Friday
evening,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>

<p>Later, in the hall, as the outer door shut
behind the group of departing men, Austen
turned on his sister, his nostrils tense with
dilation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you realize what you are doing?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Have you utterly lost sight of how
this man was regarded by your father, if you
prefer to put consideration for me out of the
matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet continued to unfasten her long
glove. The colour was gone from her face,
and the light, but otherwise she stood outwardly
serene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
&ldquo;The fight was fair,&rdquo; she said calmly,
&ldquo;and also mutual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her brother regarded her fixedly, then he
spoke. &ldquo;Though what there is to be gained
in thus setting yourself in opposition to my
repeatedly expressed wishes I do not&rdquo;&mdash;all
at once two steely points seemed to leap
into the blue intensity of his gaze&mdash;&ldquo;unless&mdash;in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, Harriet, is it possible
that you mean to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean to what?&rdquo; she repeated. Harriet
was meeting his eyes with a look as unflinching
as his. She seemed unconsciously to
have drawn herself to her full, superb height,
but she had grown white as her gown.</p>

<p>He suddenly resumed his usual manner.
&ldquo;Take the child on to bed,&rdquo; he said,
glancing at Alexina standing startled,
looking from one to the other. &ldquo;This is no
time to have the matter out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
&ldquo;I agree with you quite,&rdquo; said his sister,
and held out a hand to the girl. Alexina
took it quickly, impulsively, and held to
it as they went up the garlanded stairway,
which suddenly looked tawdry and garish.
In the hall above the girl lifted Harriet&rsquo;s
hand and put her cheek against it, then almost
ran in at her own door.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>


<p>The Blairs met about the breakfast table
next morning at the usual time; a matter of
four hours for sleep instead of eight would
have been insufficient excuse to Austen for
further upsetting of routine; and there was
none of the chit-chat that would seem natural
on a morning following the giving of a
large social affair.</p>

<p>Aunt Harriet was dumb and Uncle Austen
tense, or so it seemed to the third and youngest
Blair about the board. She had been
conscious of sharp interchange checked as
she entered. Uncle Austen even forgot to
look up at her interrogatively as she came in,
though she was a moment late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
Was the trouble still about the Major?
Was Aunt Harriet determined to go with
him Friday evening?</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, Friday came, with
the strained relations between sister and
brother unrelieved.</p>

<p>The town was in the midst of its social
season, the Blair reception being one of several
crowding each other. On this Friday
Harriet and Alexina were to attend an afternoon
affair, and later Alexina was to go to
an evening occasion with her uncle, who had
consented icily, as though to emphasize the
fact that it was Harriet&rsquo;s engagement which
made it necessary for him to take the girl.</p>

<p>Alexina, coming down a little before five,
found Harriet standing in the parlour, ready,
gloves on and wrap on a chair. To be
young is to be ardent. Not all youthful
things are young. Alexina was young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
&ldquo;You are beautiful, Aunt Harriet,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>

<p>But it was as if Harriet did not hear. Was
it premonition, that strained absorption?</p>

<p>&ldquo;A moment, Alexina,&rdquo; she was saying.
&ldquo;Listen, was that the bell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, probably,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;to let
us know the carriage is waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was Major Rathbone who came in
upon them in his quick fashion a moment
later. His overcoat was a cape affair which
somehow seemed to suit his personality, and
ever after Alexina could see him throwing
the cavalier-like drapery back with impatient
gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not gone then, Harriet,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I am glad for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quickly as the words were spoken, the
Harriet on his lips was not lost upon Alexina.
She turned to go, quite hot and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
impulsive haste, but the Major, putting out
a hand, detained her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Alexina; I&rsquo;d really rather you
would stay if you will be so kind,&rdquo; he said,
then turned to the older woman. &ldquo;I have
just had some words with your brother on
the club-house steps and I knocked him
down. I came on straight here, preferring
you should hear my regret from myself. I
lost my temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was facing Harriet, who had taken a
step towards him at his entrance, then had
stopped. Looking at her he went on
rapidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is this I want to say. Yesterday
I thought never to have the right to say it
since I was too poor to ask you to listen.
To-night I came here to say that I love you
from my soul, and near you or away from
you, alive or dead, will go on loving you and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
wanting you. Had you been poor I would
have fought like any man to make you care;
as it is I knocked your brother down for saying
I was trying to do it because you are
rich, to further my political ambition. I
knocked him down for that, and for some
other, older reasons. There is nothing
more to say; no, in the divine bigness of
your nature don&rsquo;t think you have to speak.
I cannot come here any more, even if you
would permit me, after what has happened,
and I can&rsquo;t expect you to go to-night of
course. But if ever I can serve you I am
yours, soul and body, and will be while there
is life in me. That&rsquo;s all at last. What,&rdquo;
as he turned, &ldquo;crying, Miss Alexina? For
me? Or for him? I assure you there was
little hurt but his arrogance. Dare I ask
you to shake hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he was gone in his abruptly quick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
fashion and the latch of the outer door was
heard clicking behind him.</p>

<p>It aroused Harriet and she came to herself.
She was trembling, but on her face
was a look of one who has entered Heaven.
Then it seemed to come to her that he was
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must&mdash;oh, stop him, Alexina. He
must know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl ran into the hall, but the outer
door was heavy, and in her haste she was
awkward getting it open. As it gave finally
the rush of wind drove her inward. The
steady rainfall of the day, freezing as it
touched the ground, had changed to finely
driven sleet. The steps glared with ice.
But already the Major was at the gate, and
through the dusk she could see his umbrella
lowered against the wind as he turned and
started up the street. She called after him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
impulsively, beseechingly, but realized the
futility of it through the fierce rush of wind
and sleet. John was just driving out the
carriage-way from the stable. Indeterminate,
she closed the door and turned back to
the parlour.</p>

<p>Harriet had sunk upon a chair, and in her
eyes, looking far off, was a light, a smile, or
was it tears?</p>

<p>She sprang up and turned, her face one
heavenly blush, as Alexina entered. Had
she thought it would be he?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone? Oh, Alexina, I must&mdash;I have
to tell him. Ring the bell. John must go for
him. After what has happened I cannot
stand it that the knowledge should all be
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she was already pulling the bell-cord
herself, then turned to Alexina blushing and
radiant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am thirty-eight years old, Alexina; I
am not even young, and yet he cares for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bell had rung; both had heard the
far-off sound of it, but no one answered,
maid or man-servant.</p>

<p>She rang again. &ldquo;I had no time, the
words would not come, I tried to tell him,&rdquo;
she said pleadingly to Alexina, as if the girl
were arraigning her, then suddenly dropped
into the chair by the bell-cord, and with her
face in her hands against its back went into
violent weeping.</p>

<p>Alexina stood hesitant. There are times
for silence. She would go and find Katy.</p>

<p>But she met her hurrying from the kitchen
towards the parlour, the shawl over her
head full of sleet and wet. She was panting
and her eyes were large. Alexina was
vaguely conscious of the cook, breathing
excitement, somewhere back in the length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
of the hall, and behind her some trades-boy,
his basket on his arm, his mouth
gaping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Major Rathbone,&rdquo; said Katy, panting;
&ldquo;John ran into him coming out the
carriage gate. The horses slipped and he
had his umbrella down and didn&rsquo;t see. I
was coming from the grocery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;Katy, oh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet had heard and was already in
the hall and struggling with the outer
door. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;it won&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, Alexina,
help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Katy had reached the door too, and put
her hand on the knob. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve already
started to the infirmary with him, Miss Harriet,
John and that young doctor across the
street, before I came in. He told them to
take him there himself. He was half up,
holding to the fence, before John was off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
box. &lsquo;Stop the doctor there getting in his
buggy,&rsquo; he said to John, &lsquo;and get me around
to the infirmary.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the doctor&mdash;what did he say?&rdquo;
demanded Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said &lsquo;Good Lord, man!&rsquo; and he
swore just awful at John being so slow helping
get him in the carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet all at once was herself, perfectly
controlled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go get me my long cloak, please, Katy,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Harriet,&rdquo; from Katy; &ldquo;you
ain&rsquo;t thinking of goin&rsquo; out&mdash;it&rsquo;s sleetin&rsquo;
awful&mdash;without the carriage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Harriet already had reached the
stairs going for the wrap herself.</p>

<p>Alexina followed her. &ldquo;What is it, Aunt
Harriet?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
Harriet answered back from her own
doorway. &ldquo;To the infirmary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Action is the one thing always understood
by youth. Alexina entirely approved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go, too,&rdquo; she said, and ran into her room to
change her wrap for a darker one.</p>

<p>There was but one infirmary at the time
in the city, and that a Catholic institution.
They could walk a square and take a car to
the door. Alexina, in her haste, never
thought of money, but Harriet, as she came
down, had her purse.</p>

<p>Neither spoke on the way; it was all they
could do to keep umbrellas open in the
fierce drive of wind and sleet. Alexina bent
her head to catch breath; the sleet whipped
and stung her face, the wind seized her loose
cape, her light skirts, bellying them out behind
her. But Harriet, ahead, tall, poised,
went swiftly on, and, in the light from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
street gas-post as they waited for a car, her
face showed no consciousness of storm or of
aught about her. Yet it was Harriet who
stopped the car, who made the change, and
paid the fares. The ride into town was in
silence. It was Harriet who rang the bell
before the infirmary building, who led the
way over the icy pavement, up the wide
brick walk through the grounds; it was Harriet
who rang the bell at the big central door,
and it was she who entered first past the
little Sister who opened that door.</p>

<p>Not that the little Sister meant to permit
it&mdash;it was against rules, she assured them,
visiting hours were over. She could tell
them nothing. The doctors were with the
gentleman now.</p>

<p>But she let them in. Prison doors must
have opened to Harriet that night, she
would have put the little Sister aside if need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
be and walked in, Alexina felt that. Perhaps
the little Sister felt it too. She glanced
at Harriet furtively, timidly, and, murmuring
something about going to see, glided
away.</p>

<p>The two stood in the hall, Alexina gazing
at the patron Saint of the place, in marble on
his pedestal. After a time the little Sister
returned and told them the doctor would see
them presently and said something about the
parlour, but Harriet shook her head.</p>

<p>Again they waited, the woman and the
girl sitting in chairs against the painted wall,
facing the Saint in his niche. The instincts
of long ago arose within Alexina, and unconsciously
her lips moved for comfort to
herself in a prayer to the benign old Saint before
her, there being nothing incongruous to
her that she was using a little form of child&rsquo;s
prayer taught her by her Presbyterian aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
And still they waited, so long that Alexina
felt she could not stand the silence longer,
or the waiting. She looked at Harriet, who
was gazing before her, her face colourless,
her eyes unseeing. Alexina began to wonder
if the Sister had forgotten they were there.</p>

<p>But at last she came stealing noiselessly
back, and, following her, a young man.</p>

<p>Alexina recognized him at once as the
young doctor she had seen going in and out
the cottage, and whose name she remembered
was Ransome.</p>

<p>Harriet arose to meet him. He was
young and boyish and looked unnerved.
&ldquo;The others will be down in a moment&mdash;the
other doctors&rdquo;&mdash;he told her; &ldquo;when I
saw it was bad&mdash;you know I&rsquo;m just beginning&mdash;I
turned it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His nice blue eyes looked quite distressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How bad?&rdquo; asked Harriet steadily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
He looked at her quite miserably, the boy,
then gathered himself together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;may I
know who I am talking to?&rdquo; though true to
tell he knew who she was, living as he did
across from her, but in his young embarrassment
did not know how to say so.</p>

<p>The tall, beautiful woman stood a moment
before him, then a slow colour came up over
her throat and face. &ldquo;I am Miss Blair&mdash;Major
Rathbone is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina had come close to her side and her
young eyes were on the doctor&rsquo;s appealingly.</p>

<p>He understood; doubtless he had heard
the two names connected before; the affairs
of the wealthy Miss Blair and the somewhat
famous editor were likely to be talked
over in a city the size of Louisville, or, perhaps,
being young, he merely divined. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
distress increased; he looked quite wretched.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad&mdash;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry to be the one
to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did she grow taller, whiter? &ldquo;Are you&mdash;are
the doctors still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are through for the present and
coming down now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go to him. Oh, but I
must&rdquo;&mdash;this to the horrified little Sister&rsquo;s
upraised hands of protest and headshake of
negation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against all rules,&rdquo; ejaculated the
little Sister.</p>

<p>Miss Blair addressed herself to the young
doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindly take me to the room,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The abashed young fellow looked from
one to the other. But he started. The little
Sister, however, hastily interposing herself
between Miss Blair and progress, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
heard to murmur that name of authority&mdash;the
Mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and bring her,&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>

<p>The Sister departed in haste, to return
speedily with the Mother, her calm face beneath
its bands mild, benignant, but inexorable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am,&rdquo; returned Harriet to anything
she could say. &ldquo;I am going to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dominant calmness of the Mother
had met its equal. Finally, in her turn, she
retreated behind authority and mentioned
Father Ryan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Harriet, &ldquo;go and bring him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came, heavy of jowl, keen and humorous
of eye, but his manner disturbed,
distraught, as with one whose absorption is
elsewhere. Suddenly Harriet remembered
that he was the intimate, the friend of Major
Rathbone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am going to him,&rdquo; said Harriet; &ldquo;nothing
that you can say makes any difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Father gazed at her thoughtfully.
Then he nodded. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you
are right; nothing will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the two other physicians came
down the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word with you first, gentlemen,
please,&rdquo; said the Father. The four men
gathered at the foot of the stairway.</p>

<p>Watching, an outsider would have said
that the priest and the young doctor were
pleaders with the others for the cause of
Miss Blair.</p>

<p>Later, the Mother herself led Harriet up
the stairs and along a corridor, the young
doctor following with Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&mdash;do you think I ought to go
with her?&rdquo; Alexina had faltered to him.</p>

<p>The two young things gazed at each other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
indeterminate. Alexina&rsquo;s eyes were swimming,
like a child&rsquo;s, with unshed tears.
Never has tragedy such epic qualities as in
youth. Then he turned and led the way.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;I think if I were you I
would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet was by the bed when they entered,
gazing down on the lean, brown face of the
man, whose eyes were closed. The Sister
in charge, sitting on the other side, was
speaking in a low voice. Had she seen fit to
tell what she knew?</p>

<p>For Harriet turned as they entered and
looked at them. Her face was set as in marble.
It was cold, it was stern; only, the
eyes fixed on the young doctor&rsquo;s face were
imploring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he wake first?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>The young fellow seemed to shrink before
the majesty of her suffering. Alexina put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
out a hand to touch her and drew it back,
afraid. If only she were not so superbly
self-controlled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he will most likely awake,&rdquo; he assured
her, and must have done so even if he
had not thought it.</p>

<p>She took off her hat, a large, festive affair
with plumes and jewelled buckles, and
dropped her wrap. There was a low chair
near the bed. She drew it close and sat
down, her eyes on the face on the pillow.
Jewels gleamed in the lace of her gown,
and the shining silk of its folds trailed the
floor about her.</p>

<p>Alexina stole across to a far and shadowed
corner of the room and sat down by a table.
She was crying and striving to keep it noiseless.</p>

<p>The doctor stood irresolute, then made a
movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you have to go?&rdquo; said Harriet, turning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I expect to be here in the building
all night. There might come a&mdash;change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, please,&rdquo; she asked him; &ldquo;here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down by the open fire and she
turned again to the face on the pillow.</p>

<p>The night passed. Now and then the
Sister moved noiselessly about, or the doctor
came to the bedside, lifted the inert hand,
laid it down, and went back to the fire.</p>

<p>Alexina moved from her chair to the window
or to the fire and back again. Now
and again she knew that she must have
slept a little, her head against the table. So
the night passed.</p>

<p>The square framed by the window sash
was turning grey when there came a movement,
and the eyelids of the face on the pillow
lifted. Harriet was leaning over before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
the others, the nurse or doctor, got to the
bed, and must have been there when the eyes
opened. She must have seen consciousness
of her presence in them, too, and possibly
questioning, for she spoke rapidly, eagerly,
like one who had said the thing over and
over in readiness for the moment, though
her voice shook. &ldquo;You said you loved me
from your soul, and, living or dead, would
go on loving and wanting my love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There seemed no wonder in the voice replying,
only content. There was even the
usual touch of humour in his reply. &ldquo;And
will go on wanting your love,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am here to tell you how I love
you,&rdquo; she returned.</p>

<p>The room was still, like death. Then in
the man&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Is this pity, Harriet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice hurried on. &ldquo;And how, living or
dead, I will go on loving and wanting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
It was no pity that trembled in her voice,
it was passion. He moved.</p>

<p>After a time he spoke again. It was to
call her name, to say it as to himself. This
time he knew it was love this woman was
talking of, not pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not bear it that you should not
know,&rdquo; she hurried on to tell him. &ldquo;I
made them let me come to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know then, Harriet; they have told
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was human; the sound that broke
from her was the cry of a rent soul.</p>

<p>The doctor, who had gone back to the
mantel, crouched over the fire. The Sister
seemed to shrink into the shadows beyond
the narrow bed. Alexina clenched her
hands, her head on her arms outstretched
on the table.</p>

<p>But Harriet had regained herself. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
am here to ask you something. May I
be married to you&mdash;now&mdash;at once, I
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His response was not audible, only her reply.
&ldquo;Oh, surely you will. For the rest of
my life&mdash;to have been&mdash;you will give me
this, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a quick movement from him,
and a sound of warning from the nurse who
moved forward out of the shadow.</p>

<p>Material things seemed to come back to
Harriet. Alarm sprang into her voice.
&ldquo;Shall I go away?&rdquo; she asked the nurse,
even timidly.</p>

<p>The answer came from him. &ldquo;No; oh,
no. Since it may be for so little time I may
ask it of you; stay with me, Harriet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned to the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he told her, poor boy, new to
these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then give me my way,&rdquo; Harriet begged,
turning back again. She had forgotten the
others already. &ldquo;You said that after what
happened between you and Austen you
wanted it known how you felt to me. Haven&rsquo;t
I the same right and more, since it was
my brother who said it, to want the world to
know how I feel to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They could feel the laugh in his reply.
&ldquo;The world, the world, as if you ever cared
for what the world&mdash;come, be honest, Harriet;
you say this in the generous desire of
making it up to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do&mdash;I do care. I could clap my
hands, I could glory to cry it from the house-tops,
how I care, how I am here, on my
knees, begging you will marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are kneeling? Yes? Kneel then;
even that, since it brings you closer. But
let&rsquo;s not talk of this now. I&rsquo;m not used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
the knowledge of the first yet. Will you put
your hand in mine, Harriet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl over in the shadow felt that her
heart would break. And this was love. The
great, sad thing was love!</p>

<p>He was talking again. &ldquo;I never thought,
surely, to be a stick of a man like this. I
could have made a royal lover, Harriet. A
man&rsquo;s blood at forty is like wine at its
fulness. My head&mdash;won&rsquo;t lift&mdash;God, that
it should come to find me like this! yet,
kiss me, will you, Harriet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a moment and she returned to her
pleading. &ldquo;They will send me away from
you, you know, I have no right to be here&mdash;unless
you give it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was she using this, the inference, to move
him?</p>

<p>For he caught it at once. &ldquo;You came&mdash;I
see, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
But she had fled from her position. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not that, as if I cared, as if you thought I
cared, it&rsquo;s because I want to have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the other had stuck. &ldquo;Is the doctor
there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The young fellow came to the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to see Father Ryan,&rdquo; said
the Major.</p>

<p>The priest came. The two were intimates.
He listened to the instructions, the
exigencies of the case to be met by him. A
license was necessary. &ldquo;And try and get
Miss Blair&rsquo;s brother to accompany you, and
to come here with you; you will make it all
clear to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet was looking up at the priest,
whom she saw as the friend of the man she
loved. &ldquo;And you will come back and marry
us yourself, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>He was looking down at her. Even after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
the long night, in the cold light of a winter
dawn, and in the garishness of an evening
gown in daylight, she was triumphantly
beautiful. With her hand on the smooth
brown hand of the Major, she sat and looked
up at the cassocked priest. The marble of
her face had given way to a divine light and
radiance.</p>

<p>He looked down on her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come,&rdquo; he told her.</p>

<p>It was some hours before he was back.
The young doctor had gone and come.
Dawn had broadened into a grey and sullen
day. Breakfast was sent up and placed in
an adjoining room for Harriet and Alexina.
The girl tried to eat, if only to seem grateful
to the Sister bringing it, but Harriet
wandered about the room, and, when Alexina
brought her a cup of coffee, shook her
head. She watched the door until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
doctors were gone and she might return to him,
then went in and sat by him again. His
eyes were closed, but his hand, seeking as she
sat down, found hers. Later, as the priest
returned, the gaze from the pillow turned to
the door eagerly. Austen was not with him.
The face steeled.</p>

<p>The Mother came in, and at a sign from
the priest they gathered around, Alexina,
the young doctor, the nurse.</p>

<p>With his hand in Harriet&rsquo;s the Major followed
to the end.</p>

<p>Nor was he going to die. There was
deeper knowledge of life yet for the woman
by him to learn.</p>

<p>Afterward, Doctor Ransome drove Alexina
home in his buggy, where she and the
voluble, excited Katy packed some things
for Harriet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Harriet never to let us hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
a word, and Maggie and me never closing
our eyes all the night, Miss Alexina,&rdquo; Katy
said.</p>

<p>And Harriet Blair a person usually so observant
and punctilious about everything!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Blair, he asked where you were,
Miss Harriet and you, when he came, and
then he dressed and went to the party he
was going to take you to, as if nothing had
happened. And the Father came this morning
and talked, but Mr. Blair hardly said a
word, and when they left the priest went one
way and Mr. Blair he went the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Ransome came in his buggy and
took Alexina back. On reaching the infirmary
they found that Major Rathbone&rsquo;s
sister from Bardstown, who had been sent
for, had arrived. Alexina had not known
that he had a sister until she found her in the
room next to the Major&rsquo;s, with Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
She was childlike and small and was looking
at Harriet, helpless and frightened. She
was, it proved, twenty-three years old, and
a widow with two children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Stevie takes care of us,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Stevie&rdquo; was the Major; &ldquo;us&rdquo;
was herself and the babies.</p>

<p>She had brought both the babies. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t leave them and come, you know,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>One of them lay on the bed, asleep, a little
chap four years old, his coat unfastened, his
hair tumbled. The other, the younger,
asleep too, lay on the mother&rsquo;s knee, Harriet
regarding him. He was aquiline, lean
and handsome, baby as he was, like a little
deer hound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name is Stevie,&rdquo; said Stephen&rsquo;s sister.</p>

<p>Harriet looked up from the child to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
mother, almost jealously. &ldquo;Then he is
mine, too; I have some part in him too, since
his name is Stephen.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>


<p>For two months Austen Blair and his niece
lived on in the big house.</p>

<p>Alexina wondered if her uncle were not
different from other people, for it must be
the abnormal human who would not ask one
question about his sister; mere curiosity
must have demanded that much, Alexina
thought, having a lively curiosity herself.
To be sure, Aunt Harriet, from Uncle Austen&rsquo;s
standpoint, had outraged every convention
to which they had been bred; she
had married a man between whom and her
family there had been bitterest enmity, between
whom and her brother there had been
personal encounter; she had gone from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
brother&rsquo;s roof to be married in a Catholic
institution, by a Catholic priest.</p>

<p>It almost made Alexina laugh when she
summed up the enormity of the offending.
She gloried in it herself; she adored Aunt
Harriet and loved her for it.</p>

<p>But the fact that her uncle could thus ignore
the whole subject made it harder for
Alexina to go to him about a matter which
had arisen concerning herself.</p>

<p>A letter had come to her from her mother.
Though it was eleven years since she had
seen the handwriting, she knew it, as Katy,
bringing the mail, handed it to her.</p>

<p>It seemed to Alexina that her pulses stopped
and the tide of her blood flowed backward.
Katy, closing the door as she went,
brought her to herself, and she flung the letter
from her the width of the room, her gaze
following it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
She sat like one stunned with horror.
Then rage succeeded. &ldquo;What right had
this&mdash;this so-called mother to write to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she need not read it, and Alexina
sprang up and went about her household
duties, as if in interviews with grocery-man
and butcher, with cook and laundress, she
could forget that her mother had written
her, that the letter lay up-stairs awaiting her.</p>

<p>She would not read it, she assured herself;
but all the while she knew that she would,
and when the time came she opened it quietly
and read it through. Then she put it in
its envelope and threw it from her again
across the room, and sat immovable, the
lines of her young face setting as though by
some steeling process. Suddenly she caught
sight of her face in the glass. On it was the
look of Uncle Austen.</p>

<p>She sprang up and, dragging forth her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
cloak and hat and furs, fled from the house.
She must turn to some one, she must get
away from the horror that was upon her.
She would go to Aunt Harriet.</p>

<p>It was a frosty day and a light fall of snow
was on the pavements. She met Dr. Ransome
and Emily Carringford strolling along
as though it were summer. She had introduced
him to Emily, and one would say she
had done him a good turn. She smiled as
they called to her from across the street. He
admired Emily and it looked as if Emily&mdash;but,
then, Emily sparkled and glowed for
any man, even for Uncle Austen.</p>

<p>She saw Georgy wave his hat gaily from
the platform of a street-car and look as
though he meant to swing off and join her.
She was seeing a good deal of him these
days. She shook her head and pointed with
her muff, and a moment later turned in at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
the Infirmary gate. She had walked rapidly
and felt better somehow. The Major
was daily growing stronger, though the fear
was that he might never walk again, but,
rather than accept this verdict, he and Aunt
Harriet were going East for advice or, if need
be, to Paris.</p>

<p>Paris! The horror surged back upon her.
She stopped short in her very turning to close
the gate and stood engrossed with the misery
of it, for it was from Paris her mother had
written to say she was coming to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have reached the end of my money,
ma chere,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;as you come into
yours, which Austen, being a Blair, will have
cared for. I will teach you to love life, now
that you are grown. When you were a
child you were impossible, you disconcerted
and judged me, but it is unfair to let you
taste life according to Blair seasoning only.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
So write me, ma fille, mon enfant, of your
whereabouts, in the care of your Uncle
Randolph in Washington, for I follow this
steamer across.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, as though her mood had
changed: &ldquo;In any case, I shall not trouble
you long. It is my lungs, they tell me. It
is a curious sensation, may you never know
it, having your furniture seized. Le bon
Dieu and Celeste have stood between me
and much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celeste! Tall, gaunt, and taciturn&mdash;negro
mammy to Alexina and to Molly before
her. Celeste! It all stifled the girl.
She hated Celeste. Celeste had chosen to
go with the mother, and the child had been
left by both.</p>

<p>And where was M. Garnier, the husband&mdash;&ldquo;the
promising young French poet,&rdquo; as
Uncle Randolph had termed him to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
one, in the child Alexina&rsquo;s hearing, those
years ago? The letter made no mention of
him.</p>

<p>Alexina closed the Infirmary gate and
walked up the wide pavement to the entrance.
The little Sister knew her well now
and smiled a welcome as she let her in.
Passing along the hall Alexina hesitated before
the marble saint in his niche. Hers
was no controversial soul; what she wanted
was comfort. Perhaps the blend of Presbyterianism
and Catholicism may be tolerance.
Then she went on through the spotless
halls to the second floor.</p>

<p>As the door opened Harriet looked
around. She had been writing by the
Major&rsquo;s couch, and he had fallen asleep, his
hand on hers, the portfolio lying open on her
lap. She smiled at Alexina, then nodded
at the hand detaining her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
Could it be the same Aunt Harriet, this
yearning-eyed woman? Her hair, always
beautiful, had loosened and drooped over
her temple, and the thought swept upon
Alexina, how human, how sweetly dear it
made her look, this touch of carelessness because
of greater concern. It moved the girl,
bending to kiss her, to slip to her knees instead
and throw adoring young arms about
her.</p>

<p>And then a strange thing happened; the
head of the woman drooped for support
against the girl&rsquo;s shoulder and, with a sudden
trembling all through her, Harriet began
to cry. Only for a moment; then, lifting
her head and putting the hand of the
sleeper gently on the couch, she arose and
drew the girl over to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; Dr. Ransome has arranged to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
with us then. I don&rsquo;t know why I cry, for
he&rsquo;s better. He&rsquo;s been dictating an editorial.
I&rsquo;m unnerved, I suppose, and it&rsquo;s beginning
to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are worn out with the two months
of strain, Aunt Harriet, and the worry and
unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhappiness?&rdquo; Harriet laughed a little
wildly. &ldquo;Unhappiness? I thought you
understood better than that. I&rsquo;m happy,
for the first time in all my easy, prosperous,
level life. It&rsquo;s out of the depths we bring up
happiness, Alexina. And come what may,
I&rsquo;ve known, am knowing it&mdash;nothing can
take the knowledge from me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was crying again, her head bent
against the window pane. &ldquo;I never knew
how to get near to any one; I&rsquo;ve been alone
all my life till now. Maybe you have been
lonely all along. I didn&rsquo;t know. Living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
with Austen and me&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;m sorry for
you, Alexina. I&rsquo;m going away now with
Stephen; but when we come back I mean to
make it up to you and see that you have opportunities
and friends. Oh, Alexina, we
do all require it, the joy of having some one
needing us. And you&rsquo;ll be nice to Louise
for me, won&rsquo;t you, while we&rsquo;re gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Louise was the sister of Stephen, and she
and the babies were to remain in Louisville
in the house the Major and Harriet had
taken against their return, an unpretentious
house on a cross street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stephen has arranged it all,&rdquo; Harriet was
saying; &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t let me do a thing. He
will not consider for a moment that he isn&rsquo;t
going to be able to keep his position on the
paper; they&rsquo;re filling it for him among themselves
still. If he wasn&rsquo;t so&mdash;so fiercely
proud! It&rsquo;s Austen that rankles, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
There was a movement on the couch.
Harriet went swiftly over to the waker. It
is on Olympus they take time for deliberate
and stately progression; Harriet had come
down to the human world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a soporific thing,&rdquo; quoth the Major,
&ldquo;listening to one&rsquo;s own editorials. I never
heard one through before. You there,
Alexina? Where have you been these two
days? I hope you&rsquo;re not holding it against
us that Georgy is sending all his flowers to
me? It&rsquo;s his delicate way, you see; reaching
round through me via Harriet to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a tap and the little Sister entered.
It was company. It was always
company. The Major&rsquo;s life had been close
to the heart and centre of things. It was
laughable to see the reserved Harriet&rsquo;s pride
in his popularity. It was a certain judge
this time, and with him an old comrade-at-arms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
come up from the Pennyroyal to see
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But had you better?&rdquo; Harriet expostulated.</p>

<p>The Major caught her hand and laughed
at her. &ldquo;But these are fond farewells, you
see, dear lady,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>Was he drawing her to him by the hand
he held? For suddenly Harriet bent over
and kissed him; nor did Alexina feel any
consciousness or shame, and the little Sister
went out softly with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>So it came about that Alexina did not open
her heart to Harriet after all, and the aunt
went away next day without knowing.</p>

<p>Yet Harriet influenced the girl in her decision.</p>

<p>Alexina, standing at her window, watched
a sparrow tugging at some morsel that had
fallen upon the snow and essaying to fly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
upward and away with it. She was lonesome;
the house was so big; it seemed so
empty. She was thinking about Aunt Harriet,
who was giving her strength out to
some one, who had opened her arms to
Louise and the babies, whose days were
full of thought and planning, and through
whose eyes shone something never there
before.</p>

<p>Alexina left the window and re-read the
postscript of her letter. &ldquo;In any case I shall
not trouble you long. It is my lungs, they
tell me. It is a curious sensation, may you
never know it, having your furniture seized.
Le bon Dieu and Celeste have stood between
me and much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was to her uncle after all that Alexina
went with the matter that night. He was in
the parlour reading and laid down his paper
to give attention. The substance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
letter heard, the two perpendicular lines
between his brow relaxed, for it was a case
of his judgment being justified, and a man
likes to feel he has been right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I expected,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only
it has been longer coming. She has her
father&rsquo;s people in Washington, she has no
claim on you.&rdquo; He lifted his paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>He lowered it and waited.</p>

<p>Her mouth grew set. He always made her
stubborn. Fingering the upholstery of his
chair, she looked at him, though it took
courage to look at Austen Blair under some
circumstances. She found herself suddenly
disposed to defend her mother. &ldquo;But if
I feel a claim, Uncle Austen? I wanted
to tell you I think I ought to write to her
to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come where?&rdquo; asked Austen Blair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
To be sure&mdash;where could she write her to
come? There fell a silence.</p>

<p>Then he spoke, and curtly. &ldquo;In three
months you will be of age, a fact which no
doubt your mother has remembered. Until
then I forbid it; after that it is your affair.
In the interim, it has been my intention, and
I meant to say as much to you, to make you
acquainted with your affairs. I had expected
you to live on in my house. Under the
conditions you propose you will, of course,
make your own arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina, listening, looked at him. One
would have said tears were welling. Had he
raised his eyes to hers, put out a hand&mdash;</p>

<p>But he returned to his paper.</p>

<p>Her cheeks blazed, her head went up, and
something ran like a vivifying flame over her
face. It was a pity Austen did not see her
then. He demanded beauty in a woman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
He should have seen his young niece angry.
Then she turned and went up to her room
and wrote her mother to come. But, the
letter written, she leaned upon the desk and
broke into wild and passionate crying.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>


<p>Alexina for several years had been made
partially acquainted with her affairs.</p>

<p>The evening her uncle chose to go over
the whole with her, Alexina, in the midst
of it, put a hand timidly on his. &ldquo;I am
grateful, Uncle Austen, you know that,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>The matter of the mother was fresh between
them. &ldquo;I have been paid, as any one
else, for my services,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>She drew her hand back.</p>

<p>The books were a clear record of what had
been done year by year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cowan Steamboat Mortgage,&rdquo; read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
Alexina from a page of early entries. &ldquo;What
was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mortgage held for you on a boat built
at the Cowan shipyards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the name of the boat?&rdquo; Alexina&rsquo;s
voice sounded suddenly strained and
odd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;King William,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Austen.
&ldquo;The boat never paid for itself, and the
mortgage was foreclosed and the boat sold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes narrowed with curious intentness.
As she listened she pushed her
hair back with the hand propping her head
as if its weight oppressed her. &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Here are more entries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought the boat in at a figure a little
over the mortgage; river affairs were down.
Later, a couple of years&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find it
there&mdash;the boat sold for double the price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She closed the book. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
believe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for one evening.&rdquo; But
it is doubtful if he was at all aware of anything
strange in her tone.</p>

<p>She tripped on her skirts, so impetuous
was her flight up the stairs, and, in her room,
flung herself upon the bed. Her hands even
beat fiercely as she cried, but there was no doll
Sally Ann to be gathered in for comfort now.</p>

<p>They had loved her, they had been good
to her. Mrs. Leroy had rocked her, the Captain
had held her on his knee.</p>

<p>She sprang up and went to bathe her eyes.
If she knew where they were, or how to find
them, she would go&mdash;</p>

<p>She wondered if Emily or her mother had
known about this.</p>

<p>She went to the Carringfords&rsquo; the next
afternoon. She liked to go over to the little
brown house and she liked Emily&rsquo;s strong-featured,
outspoken mother; there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
certain homely charm even in the clear-starched
fresh calico dresses she wore.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carringford was drawing large
loaves of golden-brown bread from the oven
as Alexina came in by way of the kitchen
door. The smell of it was good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Alexina,&rdquo; she said, as
she rose and turned the loaves out onto a
clean crash towel spread upon the table. &ldquo;I
want a word with you before you go up-stairs.
It&rsquo;s about Emily; you know, I
suppose, that your uncle is coming over
right often to see her?&mdash;That big hat looks
well on your yellow hair, Alexina&mdash;And
I&rsquo;m going to be plain: it&rsquo;s bad for Emily;
she&rsquo;s discontented with things now, she
always has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina&rsquo;s eyes dilated. &ldquo;Coming to see
Emily? Does&mdash;does Emily want him to
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
&ldquo;Alexina,&rdquo; called Emily down the stairs;
&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you coming up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina went up to the room which Emily
shared with her two little sisters. It
was hard on her. There were various attempts
to have it as a girl fancies her room.
The airiness of Swiss muslins, however
cheap, the sheen of the colour over which
the airiness lies, the fluttering of ruffled
edges&mdash;these seem to be expressions of girlhood.
But Emily&rsquo;s little sisters shared the
room with her. They were there when
Alexina entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now go out,&rdquo; Emily told them; &ldquo;we
want to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little girls looked up. Miss Alexina
was tall and fair and friendly, she wore lovely
dresses, she went to balls, and they adored
her. She felt the flattery and liked it too.
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she interceded, &ldquo;no, don&rsquo;t, Emily.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Emily; &ldquo;we want to talk.
Go on, Nan&mdash;Nell; don&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little sisters gathered up books and
slates with some show of resentment; it was
their room too. Emily shut the door behind
them.</p>

<p>The breadths of a light-hued silk dress
were lying about the room. Emily was ripping
on the waist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dress Miss Harriet
gave mother for a quilt while you were
away, but I told her it would be no such
thing if I could devise it otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She frowned, then threw the waist down.
&ldquo;Not that I don&rsquo;t hate it&mdash;the devising,
the scheming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Alexina bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is easy for you to say,&rdquo; retorted
Emily, her eyes sweeping Alexina from top
to toe. Harriet Blair knew how to dress the
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s
true.&rdquo; It was part of her hold on Emily, her
fairness. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re welcome to anything
of mine; I&rsquo;ve reason somehow to hate &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour heightened on Emily&rsquo;s face
and she looked eager. Passion expresses
itself variously. The stern old grandfather
abased and denied the physical and material
needs. Emily exulted in the very sheen of
rich fabric, in the feel of satin laid to cheek.
Was the grandchild but fulfilling the law of
reaction? The soul of Emily and the soul
of the old preacher saw each other across a
vast abyss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the Orbisons&rsquo; I need a dress,&rdquo;
said Emily. &ldquo;Of course, I know it&rsquo;s because
I have a voice I&rsquo;m asked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, knowing that for herself she never
would have been asked, there was exultation
in Emily&rsquo;s tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
Alexina got up suddenly. Somehow she
didn&rsquo;t want to discuss the Leroys with Emily
after all.</p>

<p>Down-stairs she stopped again in the spotless,
shining kitchen, the clean odour where
soft-soap is used always lingering. Alexina
liked it; all her knowledge of the dear homely
details of life she was familiar with, she
had gotten here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember the Leroys?&rdquo; she asked
Mrs. Carringford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; I sent them milk twice a
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know why they went away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it because they had put everything
into that&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat?&rdquo; suggested the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boat&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Carringford accepted the
word&mdash;&ldquo;and so had to, after it was&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sold,&rdquo; supplied Alexina. &ldquo;Did you&mdash;did
people know who it was held the mortgage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plain-spoken Mrs. Carringford looked
embarrassed. &ldquo;Well, Alexina, you know
how it is in a neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you knew the boat was bought in
for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the Leroys know it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, naturally, I should suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all that Alexina wanted to know,
yet not all, either. Her colour rose a little.
It made her pretty. &ldquo;Do you know anything
of the Leroys since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carringford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you hear from Miss Harriet and
Major Rathbone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are still East. Dr. Ransome came
back yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes; I know he did,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carringford.
&ldquo;He was here to see Emily last night.
He&rsquo;s a nice boy.&rdquo; There was emphasis in
her way of making the statement. Harriet
Blair had once remarked that Mrs. Carringford
was that anomaly&mdash;a sane woman.
Yet she opposed the visits of Austen Blair
and spoke heartily concerning the other one.
&ldquo;Garrard is a nice boy; I like him.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX</h3>


<p>Alexina became twenty-one in May. She
had found that in the settling of her affairs it
would be necessary for her to remain in
Louisville and so had written her mother to
come to her there. She explained about
the change in her life to the Carringfords,
to find that they knew all about her mother;
probably her little world, Georgy, Dr. Ransome,
knew it, too, while these years she had
comforted herself with the thought that, at
least, it was her secret shame.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carringford put an arm about her
and kissed her. There was approval in the
action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
Emily looked at her, then laughed nervously,
while a vivid scarlet rose to the roots
of her chestnut hair.</p>

<p>As Alexina passed through the front-room
study going home, the old minister glanced
up from his writing and called her name. He
pushed his spectacles back onto his leonine
head, looking up as she came toward him.
She was surprised, for he never had seemed
conscious even of her comings and goings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two ties that are not of our
making,&rdquo; he told her; &ldquo;the spiritual tie between
the Creator and the created, and the
material tie between the parent and the
child. They are ties not of duty but of
nature, as indestructible as matter. God
go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt strange and choked, though she
was not sure she knew what he meant.</p>

<p>A week after she became of age she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
dismantling the bay-windowed room of such
things as were hers. Little by little it grew
as cold and cheerless as the one adjoining,
now the personality of Aunt Harriet was
gone out of it. What would become of
Uncle Austen after both were gone?</p>

<p>She had tried to force from him some
expression of feeling, at first wistfully, then
determinedly. There is a chance, had he
responded, that she would have made other
arrangements for her mother. Then she
told herself she did not care and went hotly
on with her preparations.</p>

<p>She had taken two bedrooms and a parlour
at a hotel, and had written her mother
to go directly there, but the night of her arrival
the girl felt she could not go to meet her.
It was too late an hour anyhow, she would
wait until morning, but she shrank so from
that first moment she could not sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
She and her uncle met at the breakfast
table the next morning. She made one or
two attempts at conversation. &ldquo;I go to-day,
Uncle Austen,&rdquo; she said at last, and, leaning
forward, pushed a paper across the table to
him. It was the final statement of the household
expenditures under her management.</p>

<p>Her board from her first coming had been
paid into the general house fund, and, accordingly,
she had included against herself
charge for these several days in the new
month.</p>

<p>Noting it, Austen Blair nodded; it was
the first approval accorded her for some
time.</p>

<p>She laughed. &ldquo;I go to-day,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>Her uncle, who had risen, put the paper,
neatly folded, into his wallet, then crossed
to her and put out his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will not see you again then?&rdquo; he said,
and shook hands.</p>

<p>A moment after she heard the front door
close.</p>

<p>There were the servants to bid good-by,
and that being done there was no excuse to
linger.</p>

<p>It was a warm May day; the magnolia in
the yard, the pirus japonicas, the calycanthus,
the horse chestnuts, were in bloom.
The lawn was green, the edges of the gravel
paths were newly cut and trim. Alexina, in
her muslin dress and Leghorn hat, turned
on the stone flagging and looked back at
the home she was leaving. Home?</p>

<p>The girl, pausing in the yard of the big
house, glanced across the street to a shabby
old brick cottage. Her affection was for it.</p>

<p>The hotel was in the business part of the
city near the river. A street-car would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
taken her directly there but she walked, as
if seeking to put the moment off. The way
took her past the house furnished and waiting
for Aunt Harriet and the Major. Louise
was sitting on an up-stairs window-sill with
little Stevie, and caught his small fist and
waved it to her. A curtain was fluttering
out an opened window and a comfortable
looking coloured woman was sweeping the
pavement. The place had an air of relaxation,
of comfort, already. Aunt Harriet
was going to have a home.</p>

<p>The arrangements had been made at the
hotel, and the child, for a very child she was,
went in at the ladies&rsquo; entrance where a
sleepy bell-boy sat, always nodding, past the
pillared corridor, on up-stairs, and along the
crimson-carpeted hallways. She was trembling,
her throat was dry.</p>

<p>In the suite she had taken, a bed-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
either side opened into a connecting parlour.
It was the knob of the parlour door she
turned after a tap. Then she went in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you tall, charming, baby-faced&mdash;!
Celeste, Celeste, here&rsquo;s your baby! Come
here to me, Malise. Why the child&rsquo;s hands
are cold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How foolish to have dreaded it so! It
was all gone&mdash;even the constraint. The
twelve years were as nothing. She was
again the baby child, Malise, so-called by
her mother&rsquo;s people.</p>

<p>And her mother? The linen pillows on
the sofa beneath her head looked cool and
pleasantly rumpled, and the sheer white
wrapper was fine and softly laundered as a
baby&rsquo;s. Her hair, hanging in two plaits
over the pillows, had no suggestion of carelessness;
it looked fascinating, it looked
lovely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
The mother, holding her daughter&rsquo;s
hands, was gazing up curiously, interestedly,
her lips parted, as pleased interest will
part any child&rsquo;s. There was contagious
laughter in the eyes, too, the laugh of expectancy
about to be gratified, as with children
while the curtain goes up on a new scene.
&ldquo;You are as pretty as you can be, Malise;
the Blair features used to look so solemn on
a baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo; missy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina looked around. It was Celeste,
tall, brown, regarding her with covert eyes
as of old. Celeste had never loved her, the
child had known that; her love belonged to
the mother, her first charge, her Southern
born, all her own. The father&rsquo;s blood in
this second child was alien; Celeste had resented
it as she had resented that father and
all his kind. She had been jealous for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
mother against the father and child from the
first.</p>

<p>Alexina, drawing a hand from her mother&rsquo;s,
gave it to Celeste. The old woman
took it loosely, then let it drop. Things
were to be as of old, then, between them.</p>

<p>The girl turned back to her mother.
&ldquo;But, Molly,&rdquo; the name came naturally,
she had known her mother by no other,
&ldquo;your health, you know; tell me about
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What did this dilation in Molly&rsquo;s eyes
mean? And she glanced sidewise, secretly,
as if at fear of some dreaded thing, lurking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I write about that? Oh, well,
perhaps I was, then, but not now; not at all
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The haste to disclaim was feverish, and
the look directed by Celeste at Alexina was
sullen, even while the old woman&rsquo;s strong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
resistless brown hand was pushing her mistress
back onto the pillows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got to res&rsquo; lil&rsquo; while, p&rsquo;tite; got to min&rsquo;
Celeste an&rsquo; lay back an&rsquo; res&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then to her daughter, who suddenly felt
herself a little compelled creature again, so
was she carried into the past by the old
woman&rsquo;s soft, Creole slurring: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;, lil&rsquo;
missy, &rsquo;tain&rsquo; like Madame Garnier she aire
seeck actual, but jus&rsquo; she taire, easy like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Garnier! That meant Molly!
The illusions were all gone. The girl backed
from the couch. Twelve years rolled
between Molly and herself, years full of resentment.
A slow red came up and over
the daughter&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>But Molly, back upon the pillows, gave no
sign. She flung her plaits out of the way
and slipped her arms under her head. There
is a slenderness that is not meagreness, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
delicacy; thus slight, thus pretty, were Molly&rsquo;s
wrists. The arms under her head tilted
her face so the light fell on it. It was a
narrow, piquant face, with no lines to mar its
delicacy. The odd difference in the eyebrows,
which had fascinated Alexina as a
child, one arched, one straight, lent laughter
to it even in repose. Yet the mouth drooped,
like a child&rsquo;s, with pathos and appeal.
Could one say no to that mouth, it was so
wistful? It was an alluring face, and moved
you so to tenderness, to do battle, to give protection,
that it hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw off your hat, Malise,&rdquo; suggested
Molly. &ldquo;Celeste, take her parasol from that
chair. There is so much to hear about. I
asked la femme de charge, when she was in
this morning, if she&rsquo;d ever heard of the
Blairs. Everybody used to know everything
about everybody when I was here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
before and the servants most of all, and,
mon Dieu, she knew all about them. &lsquo;Miss
Blair is married,&rsquo; she told me. &lsquo;I know that,&rsquo;
said I, for you&rsquo;d mentioned that much in
your letter, Malise. &lsquo;She ran off to get
married,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;Oh, hush,&rsquo; I told her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had retained her very colloquialisms,
this Molly, too unconscious and too indolent
to know she had them, probably, or to care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she told me all about it, how tall, cold,
proper Harriet had run off from Blair proprieties
and Austen, to marry a Southerner
and a Catholic! It&rsquo;s as if the virgin in marble
had stepped down and done it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was amused. It narrowed her
eyes till they laughed through the lashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard anything so funny in my
life, Malise, as&mdash;as Harriet eloping. What
is it Jean Garnier would quote from his
adored Shakespeare about Diana and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
icicles? Make me stop! It hurts me&mdash;to
laugh. Oh-o-h, mammy&mdash;God, mammy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The appeal died in a little choke, and the
morsel of handkerchief pressed to her mouth
showed a spot of crimson, but Celeste was
already there, putting Alexina aside. &ldquo;You
can ring fo&rsquo; lil&rsquo; ice&mdash;yonder,&rdquo; she told the
girl jealously. &ldquo;Then, efen I were lil&rsquo;
missy, I&rsquo;d go in there&mdash;that one is yo&rsquo; room&mdash;an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d shet my do&rsquo;h. When it&rsquo;s over
with, p&rsquo;tite won&rsquo;t want fo&rsquo; you to have been
in heah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But pushed into the adjoining room and
with the door shut between, Malise still
could hear. She did not want to hear; she
tried not to hear. She was awed and frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I going to die this time, Celeste?
I&rsquo;m afraid, mammy; my hands are cold.
Don&rsquo;t rub them with the rings on, you fool;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
you hurt. No, no; don&rsquo;t go away, mammy!
mammy! I couldn&rsquo;t sleep last night;
that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m tired. The night was
so long and I was afraid. I see Jean when I
try to sleep. I hear him cough. Give me
something to make me sleep&mdash;oh, mammy,
give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl in the next room stood gazing out
the window over the roofs and chimney
stacks at the yellow tide of the river sweeping
down towards the pier bridge spanning
it, but she was not seeing it. She was filled
with pity and terror.</p>

<p>It grew quieter in the next room, then
still, then the door between opened and
closed. It was Celeste, outwardly unmoved
and taciturn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;tite&rsquo;s gone to sleep. Shall I help lil&rsquo;
missy unpack her things?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>


<p>Summer in a half-grown Southern city is full
of charm; pretty girls in muslin dresses
stroll the shopping streets and stop on the
sidewalks to chat with each other and with
callow youths; picnic parties board the
street cars, and in the evenings sounds of
music and dancing float out from open doors
and windows along the residence streets.</p>

<p>Alexina, chaperoned by Harriet Blair,
would have found herself in these things,
yet never quite of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Malise,&rdquo; Molly said quite earnestly, a
day or so after her coming, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
think it&rsquo;s stuffy here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
It was stuffy; hotel rooms in summer are
apt to be; Alexina felt as apologetic as if
Molly were the one who had given up a
spacious, comfortable home to come and
live in rooms for her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she
said. She had explained the necessity for
it before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d gotten the bank to take
charge of your affairs,&rdquo; Molly reminded her;
&ldquo;so why do we have to stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, but it&rsquo;s a different thing, very,
from having Uncle Austen, personally&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped; it might seem to be reminding
Molly that she had caused the break
with Austen Blair.</p>

<p>But Molly never took disagreeable things
personally. She threw her arms back of
her head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you propose something
to do?&rdquo; she entreated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might go round to the stores,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
suggested Alexina doubtfully. She hated
stores herself.</p>

<p>Molly brightened. &ldquo;I need some summer
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina agreed, yet she wondered. Seven
trunks can disgorge a good many clothes;
&ldquo;mere debris from the wreckage of things,&rdquo;
Molly explained, though they didn&rsquo;t look it.
Yet in a way Alexina understood. It wasn&rsquo;t
the actual things Molly wanted; it was the
diversion, and so at the suggestion Molly
cheered up. &ldquo;You look pretty in summer
clothes, Malise,&rdquo; she stated with graciousness,
as they started. On the way she went
in and bought chocolates; not that she wanted
them either&mdash;it was too hot for candy,
she said&mdash;but one must be doing something.</p>

<p>Coming out the door they met Georgy,
who promptly stopped. He was a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
youngster, with a buoyant and splendid
heartiness, and now he was flushing ruddily
with pleasure up to his yellow hair.</p>

<p>Alexina blushed, too; she hardly knew
why, except that he did, and told his name
to Molly, who regarded him with smiling
eyes and gave him her hand, whereupon he
blushed still more and then suggested that
he go along with them.</p>

<p>A group of young matrons and their
daughters stood at the door of the shop to
which they were bound, chatting in easy,
warm weather fashion. Alexina knew
them slightly but Georgy knew them well,
and they were greeted with salutations and
laughter.</p>

<p>Molly smiled, too, an interested smile that
brightened as she was introduced, and she
remembered having known the mother of
this one when she, Molly, had lived in Louisville
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
before, and the husband of another one,
and all the while she was letting her eyes
smile from one to the other of the group, who
meanwhile were telling Georgy that they
were planning a dance.</p>

<p>Dance? Molly&rsquo;s eyes grew inquiringly
eager. Favors were they speaking of? She
had a trunk full of Parisian knick-knacks,
she told them. &ldquo;Come around to the
hotel,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;all of you: why not
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it was that the stream of things
gayest caught Molly and Molly&rsquo;s daughter
into its swirl. The banks along the way
were flowery, the sky was blue, and Alexina
began to find the waters of dalliance sweet.
Hitherto girlish groups had seemed to make
themselves up and leave her out, and
there always had been a disconcerting lack
of things to talk about in dressing-rooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
and strictly feminine assemblies. Now
she found herself in the planning and the
whirl, happy as any.</p>

<p>There was exhilaration, too, in this sudden
realization of what an income meant,
which she had not had much opportunity of
learning before, and these days she laughed
out of very exuberance and sudden joy in
living.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if I didn&rsquo;t really know you,
sometimes,&rdquo; said the literal Georgy, out
calling with her one evening. &ldquo;It makes
you awful pretty, you know, to be jolly this
way,&rdquo; which was meant to be more complimentary
than it sounded.</p>

<p>They were stepping up on the porch of the
house to which they were bound. Alexina
laughed and caught a handful of rose petals
from a blossoming vine clambering the post
and cast them on Georgy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
There were other swains than Georgy
these days, too, and not all of them were
youths, either, not that it mattered in the
least who they were; for in the beginning
it is the homage, not the individual, that
counts.</p>

<p>She hung over the offerings which came to
her from them with a rapture which was
more than any mere joy; it was relief. Suppose
such things had been denied her?
There are maidens, worthy maidens, who
never know them, and so Alexina blushed
divinely with relief. Roses to her!</p>

<p>And Molly, watching, would grow peevish&mdash;not
over the flowers; Molly was too
sure of her own charm for that. Alexina
really did not know what it was about, and
she did not believe Molly quite knew herself.</p>

<p>There was a lazy-eyed personage the
young people called Mr. Allie. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
mothers had called him Mr. Randall, but
then he had been the contemporary of the
mothers.</p>

<p>No daughter of these bygone belles was
secure in her place to-day until the seal of
Mr. Allie&rsquo;s half-serious, half-lazy approval
was upon her, or so the mothers and the
daughters felt. Mr. Allie was perennial,
indolently handsome, an idler in the gay
little world, yet somehow one believed he
could have gone at life in earnest had there
been need.</p>

<p>He, too, sent roses to Alexina, and flowers
from him meant something subtly flattering,
and he came strolling around at places and
sat down by her, saying pretty things to make
her blush, apparently to watch her doing it.
Not that she minded as much as she worried,
because she felt she ought to mind,
and in her heart she knew she didn&rsquo;t really.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
She had gone out with him half a dozen
times perhaps, when, one evening at a dance,
Mr. Allie, seeking, found her at the far end
of a veranda where the side steps went down
to the gravel. She and Georgy were sitting
there together. Georgy was telling her of
his aspirations and, in passing, dwelling on
the lack of any civic spirit in the town, the
inference seeming to be that Georgy, modest
as he was, some day himself meant to supply
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Allie told Georgy that a waiting damsel
was expecting him, then took Georgy&rsquo;s
place. He did not speak for a while, and
Alexina never was talkative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you rather go in and dance?&rdquo; at
last he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Which was
not quite true for she loved to dance these
days. She used to be afraid she was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
going to have a successive partner and it
marred the full enjoyment of the one she
had, but now&mdash;</p>

<p>Still, any one would be flattered to have
Mr. Allie asking, so she said no.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; he said; which was
not brilliant, to be sure, but it was the way
in which Mr. Allie said things which made
them seem pregnant of many meanings.</p>

<p>After that neither of them spoke, yet
Alexina&rsquo;s pulses began to beat. The big
side yard upon which the steps descended
was flooded with moonlight, and a mockingbird
was sending forth a trial note or two.
And it was June.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For you know, really, you&rsquo;re the very
dearest of them all,&rdquo; said Mr. Allie, with soft
decision, as if he had been arguing about it.</p>

<p>There was not a thing to say, and she
could not have said it if there had been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve known a good many,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Allie, which probably was true,
only Mr. Allie knew how true; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
never felt just this way about any of them
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they sat very still, and the bird note
rose and fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d rather go in,&rdquo; said Mr.
Allie as the music began again. Was it
hurt in his tone?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Allie picked up the end of the scarf
which had fallen to the steps and put it about
her shoulders again. It brought his face
around where he could see hers. Was he
laughing? Or were his eyes full of reproach?
For what? He did not look a bit
like a contemporary of anybody&rsquo;s mother.
Yet perhaps the moustache that drooped
over the mouth did hide&mdash;lines, and the lazy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
eyes sometimes did look tired. Youth has
its dreams, vague, secret, yet the Prince of
the dreams should be no Mr. Allie with eyes
that look weary and tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought,&rdquo; said Mr. Allie softly, oh,
so softly; &ldquo;if I thought that you could
care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;no, I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sobbed. It seemed cruel to Mr. Allie.</p>

<p>Then they talked it over, he so gently, she
with self-reproach and little chokes against
tears. He even held her hand, she too
tender-hearted to know how to take it away,
though the remorse eating into her heart was
forgotten somewhat in the glow, the wonder
that this thing, this sad but beautiful thing
should come to her. Presently he took
her in. The rest of the evening sped hazily.
Going home, she talked to Mr. Allie and
Molly as in a dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
Reaching the hotel, and in their own
apartment, Alexina sank down on the sofa,
her wrap and fan falling unobserved, and
sat, chin on palm, shyly remembering,
shrinking a little, and blushing. Suddenly
conscious, she turned and found Molly in
her doorway between, undressing, and looking
at her with knowledge and with laughter.
She had forgotten Molly, who had
been rummaging and had brought out
some olives and crackers and wine. Molly
lunched at all unheard-of hours.</p>

<p>Alexina sprang up. She turned white,
then scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest
chuck,&rsquo; Jean Garnier would say,&rdquo; Molly began,
unloosing her waist and laughing again.
&ldquo;Mais non, mon enfant, you take these
things too seriously; it is time you understood.
He has said as much to every pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
girl there, one time and another, and to most
of their mothers before them, only they all
understood. It&rsquo;s very charming in you, of
course, right now, and to a man like him,
irresistible but, still&mdash;Malise&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina looked at Molly. Then up welled
a red that rose to her hair and spread
down her throat and over her bare young
shoulders. She would never misunderstand
again. It is a cruel thing, the hotness
of shame. But Molly was staring. Malise
was beautiful with her head so proudly up
and her cheeks flaming.</p>

<p>There was more to understand. They
were a gay crowd, the young people and their
elders with whom Molly and Alexina and
Georgy were going. Things came to Alexina
slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t just nice,&rdquo; she told Molly
anxiously, an evening at the Willy Fields&rsquo;;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
&ldquo;Georgy says you&rsquo;ve all been in the pantry
opening more champagne. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re
acting like there&rsquo;s been enough, and he
thinks, too, we ought to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; said Molly. She looked
so slender, so childishly innocent standing
there where the daughter had drawn her
aside, one couldn&rsquo;t believe she had said it.
&ldquo;This is the way you used to go on when you
were a child. One would think you&rsquo;d had
your fill of what people ought to do, living
with the Blairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina looked at her. That Molly
should dare allude to that past this way!
Then she went and found her mother&rsquo;s wrap
and brought it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put it on,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Molly laughed rebelliously, then waveringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going home,&rdquo; said the daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
Molly essayed to put it on but didn&rsquo;t seem
able to find the hooks, and Alexina, hardening
her heart, would not help her, but went
to find Georgy. He was looking stern himself,
and forlorn and young, and the fact
that she knew why did not serve to make
Alexina happier.</p>

<p>The cars had stopped running and they
walked home, leaving hilarity behind them.
Molly was acting stubbornly, her tones were
injured, and her talk incessant. Alexina
couldn&rsquo;t make her stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean was just such another clog as Malise,&rdquo;
she told Georgy. &ldquo;He was forever
harping about proprieties, and he wore me
out trying to make me tie my money up;
Malise isn&rsquo;t stingy, I&rsquo;ll say that, though she
might have been&mdash;she&rsquo;s a Blair. Jean
shivered over spending money. And after
there wasn&rsquo;t any left, he used to sit and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
cough and cry over his Shakespeare about
it. He had thought he was going to be a
great poet once, himself, Jean had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the light of the setting moon one could
see Molly&rsquo;s childlike face; and her voice,
with its upward cadence, was more plaintive
than the face. The very look and the
sound of her were sweet, seductively sweet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He liked to believe himself a Gascon, too,
Jean did, and he loved his Villon too. He
wasn&rsquo;t well ever; he couldn&rsquo;t always breathe,
Jean couldn&rsquo;t, but, <i>vraiment</i>, he could swagger
as well as any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night was still, the streets asleep.
Nearing the hotel now, the way led past
blocks of warehouses and wholesale establishments.
Molly stumbled over a grating.
Georgy steadied her. They went on, their
footsteps echoing up from the flagging as
from a vault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo; complained Molly, &ldquo;and,&rdquo;
querulously, &ldquo;you know, Malise, it will
make me cough if I take cold. Jean
coughed. After he coughed for a year and
the money was gone, he raised more on our
things. Then they came and seized them,
except my trunks; Jean had sent those
away. I was sick, too; I took the cough
from Jean, and I was afraid after I heard
one could take it, so he made me come away.
Celeste had some money. He made us
come; he said it would be easier to know I
was over here, and it would be better for
him at the hospital&mdash;&lsquo;les s&oelig;urs sont
bonnes,&rsquo; Jean said over and over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina was hearing it for the first time.
People like Molly supply no background,
the present is the only moment, and Alexina
was not one to ask.</p>

<p>At the hotel entrance, in the ladies&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
deserted hallway, even the nodding bell-boy
gone, Georgy paused. Molly went and sat
down in a chair against the wall. She
laughed unsteadily, though there was nothing
to laugh about. Her lids were batting
and fluttering like a sleepy child&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I
thought you said it was late, Malise,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; entreated Georgy of Alexina, and
squared himself between her and her mother.
He was a dear, handsome boy. He gazed
pleadingly at the tall, fair-haired girl whose
eyes were meeting his so apologetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said to me there, to-night, you
couldn&rsquo;t care for me that way,&rdquo; he told her,
&ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t you marry me anyhow, Alexina,
and we&rsquo;ll take care of her together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For he thought she knew what he did.
Her eyes, which had lowered, lifted again,
doubtfully, wistfully. Was she wishing she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
could? They met his. Perhaps his were
too humble.</p>

<p>A shiver went through the girl. Then
came a sobbing utterance. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I
can&rsquo;t; but oh, if you only knew how I wish
I could!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke down in tears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mad
with me, Georgy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Georgy, preparing to go, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not that I&rsquo;m mad. I reckon you don&rsquo;t understand
these things yet, Alexina.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER EIGHT</h3>


<p>It seemed all at once as if some wilful perversity
seized Molly; at home she was so
petulant Alexina dared not cross her, for to
anger her was to make her cough; abroad
she was gayer than any, almost to recklessness.
Celeste, taciturn and secretive, kept
herself between mother and daughter insistently,
and often the door to Molly&rsquo;s room
was locked until afternoon. Mrs. Garnier
must not be disturbed, she said.</p>

<p>One of these times, a day in late July,
Alexina went out to the Carringfords&rsquo;.
Emily knew most of the comings and goings
of Alexina and her mother. In her heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
probably she was envious, though to Alexina
she was concerned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That picnic of last week is being talked
about, Alexina,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Alexina flushed, but she was honest. &ldquo;It
ought to be,&rdquo; she said. Gaiety can tread
close upon the heels of recklessness. But if
Molly went the daughter had to go, for this
very reason, though she could not tell Emily
this.</p>

<p>So she spoke of other things. &ldquo;Do you
know anything of Uncle Austen?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Is he still taking his meals down-town
and sleeping at the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily looked conscious. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I think he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow Alexina felt that Emily not only
knew but wanted it to be felt that she knew.
Then why hesitate and say only that she
thought so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Garrard?&rdquo; Alexina asked suddenly.
Garrard was young Doctor Ransome.
Emily flushed a little, but she answered
unconcernedly, &ldquo;Well enough, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Alexina&rsquo;s return to the hotel, the clerk
stopped her in the corridor, looking a little
embarrassed under the clear, surprised gaze
of the young lady. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about a little matter
with Mrs. Garnier; it&rsquo;s been running two
months now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment after, as she went on blindly
up the stairs, a folded paper in her hand,
she understood; understood what Georgy
had offered to share with her, what the taciturn
secretiveness of Celeste meant. She
went in through the parlour to her mother&rsquo;s
room, from which of late she had been so
much shut out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; she said, her voice sounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
strange to herself, as she held out the paper
open.</p>

<p>Molly, risen on her pillow, looked at it, at
her, her eyes growing big. She was frightened,
and cowered a little, crumpling some
letters in her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that, Malise,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some of the money you gave
me left&mdash;I&rsquo;ll help to pay it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That she was afraid only because of the
bill!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; Alexina breathed it rather than
uttered it.</p>

<p>Molly, risen from her elbow to sitting posture,
was looking at her with big, miserable
eyes, her throat, so slight and pretty, swelling
with the sobs coming.</p>

<p>But the other came first, and with it came
the terror. &ldquo;Malise, Malise, hold me; hold
me. I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
Celeste was out.</p>

<p>Alexina, holding her mother, could reach
the bell, and rang it, again and again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said to the boy when he
came; &ldquo;get a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What one?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Alexina remembered Dr. Ransome.</p>

<p>Then she sat and fed ice to Molly and
tried to keep her still. It is a fearful thing
to feel the close, clinging touch of a person
we are shrinking from. It was a hot, drowsy
afternoon. The clock on the parlour mantel
ticked with maddening reiteration. It
seemed hours before Dr. Ransome came.
Then a moment later Celeste returned.
Molly flung her arms out to the old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, mammy,&rdquo; she wailed;
&ldquo;Jean&rsquo;s dead; the letters came after you
went&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m afraid of it, I&rsquo;m
afraid to die!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
It was to Celeste Molly had to tell it.
The daughter listened with a sudden resentment
towards Celeste.</p>

<p>Molly was not going to be better right at
once, and Alexina and Dr. Garrard Ransome
had many opportunities for talk. She
stopped him in the parlour, as he was going,
one morning. It had been on her mind for
a long time to ask him something. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
odd, your name being Ransome,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Mrs. Leroy, who used to live where you do,
had been a Miss Ransome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my cousin Charlotte,&rdquo; said the
young fellow; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how my mother came
to fancy living where we do, when we came
down from Woodford to Louisville. She
used to visit the Leroys there you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;really? They were
very good to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blue eyes of the doctor were regarding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
her intently, but as if thought were concentrated
elsewhere. &ldquo;I wonder if it was
you Cousin Charlotte meant? I was down
there two winters ago for a month. They
live in Florida, at a place called Aden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;Aden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she asked me about some young
girl who, she said, lived across from the cottage.
Of course I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t there then,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;I
was at school. They were good to me; are
they well&mdash;and happy?&rdquo; The eagerness
was good to see, so dejected had the girl
seemed of late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, or were when mother last heard.
Happy, too, I reckon, as it&rsquo;s counted with us
poor families used to better things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about them, if you don&rsquo;t mind.
They were the best friends I ever had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, looking rather helpless in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
the undertaking, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t much to tell.
They&rsquo;re getting along. The Captain was
book-keeper for a steamboat line down
there, went home every week, but, somehow,
a year ago, they dropped him; he&rsquo;s getting
old, the Captain is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he must be. And Mrs. Leroy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin Charlotte? Well, she&rsquo;s Cousin
Charlotte. Some ways she&rsquo;s a real child
about things and mighty helpless when it
comes to managing, but she never thinks
about repining, and it&rsquo;s funny how she&rsquo;ll do
whatever King tells her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King? Oh, he&rsquo;s all right. Queer fellow
though, some ways, imperturbable as a
young owl. Best poker player down there,
and that&rsquo;s saying something. It&rsquo;s motley,
Aden is, like all those small towns since the
railroad went through &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
The young man happening to glance at
Miss Alexina, saw that he had said something
wrong. He was the only child of his
mother and so knew how ladies feel on
certain subjects. Yet, on the other hand,
Miss Alexina adored Major Rathbone, and
the Major&rsquo;s poker record, while possibly of
a more local character, was scarcely less celebrated
than his guerrilla past. Still, ladies
are expected to be inconsistent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have told that, I reckon,&rdquo;
he remarked; &ldquo;you all don&rsquo;t see these things
as we do. He&rsquo;s a fine fellow, King is. He&rsquo;s
a great shot, too,&rdquo; cheerfully; &ldquo;I went on a
week&rsquo;s hunt down in the glades with him.
King&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe he was, but it sounded as though
he was trifling. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he a business?&rdquo;
she asked with condemning brevity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about calling it a business,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
said William Leroy&rsquo;s cousin; &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s
the busiest. It&rsquo;s a big old place, you see,
the grove they own, and he&rsquo;s reclaiming
it. There&rsquo;s just one subject he&rsquo;s discursive
on, and that&rsquo;s the best fertilizer for young
orange trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow William Leroy did not shine
against this background as his well-intending
cousin meant he should. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re
poor, Mrs. Leroy and the Captain?&rdquo; asked
Miss Blair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; admitted Garrard, &ldquo;they aren&rsquo;t
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl sat thinking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down
there,&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;Is there a
hotel? There is? Then I&rsquo;m going to take
Molly and go down to see them. There&rsquo;s
something I want to tell Mrs. Leroy and the
Captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As good a place as any,&rdquo; agreed Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
Garrard. &ldquo;I told you at the start Mrs.
Garnier must not try a winter here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; declared Alexina, then
stopped. Maybe they would not be glad to
see her. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t mention the possibility
if you should be writing,&rdquo; she begged;
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t mention knowing me&mdash;please. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like to discover it all for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After he had gone she went to the piano,
near the window looking out over the warehouse
roofs to the river, and, softly fingering
some little melody, sat thinking.</p>

<p>There was a tap and Alexina turned on
the piano stool as Emily Carringford came
in. Somehow Emily, so prettily, daintily
charming in her fresh white dress, made
Alexina cross. She felt wilted and jaded,
and who cared if she did? That her present
state was brought about by her own
choosing only made her crosser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
What was it in Emily&rsquo;s manner? Had
she grown more beautiful in a night? She
dropped into a chair, and, holding her
parasol by either end across her knee, looked
over at Alexina on the stool, and, looking,
laughed. It was a laugh made of embarrassment
and complacency, half shy, half
bold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Uncle Austen last night asked me
to marry him, Alexina,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily&mdash;&rdquo; Alexina sprang from the stool
and stood with apprehension rushing to her
face in rising colour and dilated gaze. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Emily!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it foreboding in her eyes as they
swept Emily&rsquo;s girlish loveliness?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem to mind my being poor,&rdquo;
said Emily; &ldquo;he said it was my practical and
praiseworthy way of going to work that
made him first&mdash;oh, Alexina,&rdquo; she coloured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
and looked at the other, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t even
mind our little house&mdash;and mother doing
the work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sort of rage against Emily seized Alexina.
She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t he the
rather go down on his unbending knees in
gratitude that you&rsquo;ll even listen? You&rsquo;re
twenty-one and he&rsquo;s fifty-one. You have
everything, you&rsquo;re lovely, you&rsquo;ve your voice,
you haven&rsquo;t begun to live yet&mdash;oh, I know
he&rsquo;s my uncle, and I remember all he&rsquo;s done
for me, but I&rsquo;ve known him years, Emily,
<em>years</em>, and I&rsquo;ve never seen Uncle Austen
laugh once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What on earth has laughing to do with it?
Alexina always was queer. This from
Emily. Not that she said it, except in the puzzled,
uncomprehending stare at Alexina,
while she returned to what she had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
to communicate. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be married
the first day of October,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr.
Blair has to go East on some business then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina drew herself together with a laugh.
What was the use&mdash;yet she could not divest
herself of a responsibility.</p>

<p>She looked at Emily, who was looking at
her. Their eyes met. Alexina looked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emily,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a thing&rdquo;&mdash;it
took effort to say it&mdash;&ldquo;a thing maybe you
haven&rsquo;t thought of. It came to Aunt Harriet;
it comes to everybody, I feel sure.
Won&rsquo;t you be cutting yourself off from any
right to it?&rdquo; The red was waving up to
Alexina&rsquo;s very hair.</p>

<p>Emily showed no resentment at this implication
which both seemed to take for
granted, but then she was not following Alexina
very closely, her own thoughts being
absorbing. &ldquo;The wedding will have to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
in our little house,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so it won&rsquo;t
make much difference about the dress; nobody&rsquo;ll
be there. But for the rest, I&rsquo;m going
to have some clothes. I told mother
and father and grandfather so this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina went over and seized the other&rsquo;s
hands as children do. A softer feeling had
come over her. Perhaps Emily was doing
this thing to help her people. Besides,
she and Emily used to weave wonderful
garbs in bygone days, for the wearing to the
Prince&rsquo;s ball. To be sure, one never had
pictured an Uncle Austen as the possible
Prince, but still Emily should have them,
if she wanted them.</p>

<p>Alexina&rsquo;s gaze fell upon a flower lying on
the floor, which had dropped out of Garrard
Ransome&rsquo;s buttonhole. The boy loved
flowers as most men from the blue grass
country do, and the cottage yard was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
wilderness of them. She had almost forgotten
Garrard&rsquo;s share in this. She picked the
flower up and handed it to Emily. &ldquo;Dr.
Ransome has been here,&rdquo; she said, feeling
treacherous&mdash;for the other man, after all,
was her uncle.</p>

<p>Emily took it, and laid it against the lace
of her parasol, this way and that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always, as far back as I can remember,
meant to be somebody, something,&rdquo;
said Emily. She said it without emotion, as
one states a fact. Then she rose and picked
up her glove. &ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;ve thrown my
arms out and felt I could scream, it all has
seemed so poor and crowded and hateful to
me,&rdquo; which was large unburdening of self
for Emily. Then she went. At the door
she laid the flower on a chair.</p>

<p>The three weeks of Molly&rsquo;s illness brought
it to the end of August, and, as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
convalesced, Alexina began to plan for Aden. In
the midst of her preparations the Major and
Harriet returned.</p>

<p>She went out to the house the morning of
their arrival. The luggage was being unloaded
at the curb as she reached the gate,
and, hearing voices as she stepped on the
porch, she looked in at the parlour window.
Harriet, her hat yet on, was bending her
head that little Stevie, urged by his mother,
might kiss her. The baby was no shyer
about it than the woman, yet the woman
smiled as the baby&rsquo;s lips touched her face.</p>

<p>As she rose she saw Alexina and came to
the door to meet her. She kissed the girl
almost with embarrassment, yet kept hold
of her hands, while suddenly her eyes filled
with something she tried to laugh away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had your letter,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;and
resent it, too, that you are going, and so does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
Stephen.&rdquo; Her face changed, her voice
grew hesitant, hurried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never going
to be better than now&rdquo;&mdash;was it a sob?&mdash;&ldquo;but
since I may have him, may keep him,
and he is willing now to live so for me,
though not at first, not at first&mdash; Oh,
Alexina, it has been bitter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina followed her into the parlour. The
Major was there in a wheeled chair, the
babies afar off, refusing to obey the maternal
pokes and pushes to go to him, and regarding
him and his wheeled affair with furtive,
wide-eyed suspicion. The eyes of the Major
were full of the humour of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now had I been a gamboling satyr on
hoofs they would have accepted me at once,&rdquo;
he assured Alexina. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this mingling of
the familiar with the unnatural&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was holding the girl&rsquo;s hand while he
spoke and looking up keenly at her pretty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
tired face. There had been enough in her
letters for them to have divined something
of her trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To some it comes early, to others late,
Alexina,&rdquo; he said quite gently. He had
noted the signs&mdash;the violet shadows beneath
the baffled young eyes, the hint of the
tragedy in their depths.</p>

<p>Alexina sat down suddenly and, leaning
her face on the arm of the wheeled chair, began
to cry, not that she meant to do it at all.</p>

<p>Time was when Harriet would have been
at a loss, even now she was embarrassed,
though she hovered over the girl, anxious
and solicitous, and even touched the pretty,
shining hair with her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her alone: let her cry it out,&rdquo; said
the Major.</p>

<p>Alexina, groping for his hand, held to it
like a very child and cried on.</p>

<h3 class="padtop">CHAPTER ONE</h3>


<p>Immediately after the wedding Alexina and
Molly went South. Molly turned petulant
at sight of Aden and Alexina could not blame
her; indeed, she and Celeste were of a mind
with her as they drove from the station to the
hotel.</p>

<p>The horses ploughed through loose, greyish
sand, the sidewalks along the street, ostensibly
the business thoroughfare, were of
board, not in the best of repair, and the skyline
of the street was varied according as the
frame stores had or did not have a sham front
simulating a second story. Men sat on tilted
chairs beneath awnings along the way and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
stared at the occupants of the carriage as it
passed. It was mid-afternoon, which, in
Aden, seemed to be a glaring, shadeless hour
and, but for these occasional somnolent
starers, a deserted one. Yet people lived
here, existed, spent their lives in this crude,
poor hideousness, this mean newness; the
Leroys lived here! And that their son
would let them, would remain himself!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did we come for anyhow?&rdquo; queried
Molly. &ldquo;The world is full of charming
places. You do adopt the queerest notions,
Malise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Malise sat convicted. It had sounded so
alluring, so suggestive of charm and languor;
the very name of Aden had breathed a
sort of magic.</p>

<p>And Alexina had come, too, buoyed up by
a large and epic idea of restitution. How
foolish, how young, how almost insulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
from the Leroys&rsquo; standpoint it suddenly
seemed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We spent two winters in Italy, Jean and
I, and one in Algiers,&rdquo; Molly was saying
plaintively. &ldquo;Heavens, Malise, they&rsquo;re building
that house on stilts, right over a sinkhole
of tin cans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For that matter there were tin cans everywhere.
It was most depressing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even Louisville was better than this,&rdquo;
said Molly grudgingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so resigned,
Malise; it&rsquo;s not becoming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They turned a corner and the driver
stopped before a long, two-storied building,
painted white, which proved to be the hotel.
It stood up from the street on wooden posts,
the space between latticed. A railed gallery
ran across the front, steps ascending midway
of its length. Two giant live-oaks flanked
the building either end, the wooden sidewalk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
cut out to encircle their great roots,
and, while handbills and placards were
tacked up and down the rugged, seamy
trunks, yet grey moss drooped from the
branches and swept the gallery posts. The
building looked roomy, old-fashioned and
reposeful, and Alexina&rsquo;s spirits rose. She
gathered up the wraps, Celeste the satchels&mdash;no
one ever looked to Molly to gather up
anything&mdash;and they went in.</p>

<p>The place seemed deserted and asleep,
but just inside the doorway, where the hall
broadened into an office, a man stood looking
through a pile of newspapers. His
clothes were black and his vest clerical; below
its edge hung a small gold cross. He
turned politely, then said he would go and
find some one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Molly, brightening,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
Two days after, they were settled in comfortable
rooms overlooking the hotel grounds.
A slope down to a small lake boasted some
gnarled old live-oaks and pines, and one
side was set out with a young orange grove.
Across the water one could see several more
or less pretentious new houses built around
the shore. The breeze tasted of pine and
Molly had slept a night through without
coughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Heavens!&rdquo; she complained, the
second afternoon, lolling back in a wooden
arm-chair on the hotel gallery; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t there
anything to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina and the young man in clerical
garb were her audience. He was the Reverend
Harrison Henderson, and had charge
of the Episcopal Church of Aden and lived
at the hotel. He seemed a definite and
earnest man. His blond profile was strong.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
It was a rather immobile face, perhaps, but
it lighted with very evident pleasure as he
answered Mrs. Garnier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to go out to Nancy?&rdquo;
he proposed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s quite an affair for a
lake down here, and a young fellow out there
rents sail-boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming,&rdquo; agreed Molly, sitting up.
&ldquo;You have ideas; you can&rsquo;t have been here
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison smiled, though it was an
acknowledging rather than a mirthful smile.
Life is too earnest for mere laughter, but his
zeal to serve Mrs. Garnier was not to be
doubted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Miss Blair?&rdquo; he asked,
turning to that young person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&mdash;I?&rdquo; Alexina had been leaning
forward with her elbow on the gallery
railing, her eyes looking off to a line of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
pines against the sky. She had been wondering
how she should inquire about the
Leroys, and if she really wanted to. She
came back to the veranda and the present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be charming, too,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go right away. I&rsquo;ll order the
carriage, so as to see the sunset,&rdquo; he said,
and rose. &ldquo;You will need wraps for Mrs.
Garnier.&rdquo; Somehow a man never thinks
the other woman will need anything.</p>

<p>He spoke briskly and went off down the
plank sidewalk towards town with a swing.
The day was fair, the air was soft, and the
blood in the Reverend Henderson, despite
the dogmatic taint in it, was red and young.</p>


<p class="hrpad">Out at Lake Nancy Osceola, a young fellow
in flannel shirt, knickerbockers and
canvas shoes, was scanning the shore from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
a wooden pier which ran out the extent of
shallow water, having just made fast the
sail-boat rising and falling with the swell at
the pier&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>A grove of well grown orange trees
stretched up the slope from the water. The
trees were heavy with fruit and looked
sturdy and well cared for. To the right
stood the frame packing sheds, and beyond,
amid higher foliage against the cerulean
sky, showed a house roof.</p>

<p>But the young fellow on the pier was gazing
in the other direction, where, through the
straight vistas of the grove, a carriage was
being driven under the trees, the top sweeping
the fruit laden branches. The young
man hallooed as he started in the pier, but a
negro digging among the trees had dropped
his spade and was running up. The carriage
stopped and the young minister of the Aden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
Episcopal Church got out. Naturally, it
was to be supposed that it was some person
with no more common sense.</p>

<p>But there were others than the Reverend
Mr. Henderson descending&mdash;two ladies.
Some party from the hotel come for a sail,
probably.</p>

<p>It was the duty of coloured Pete to go with
sailing parties, but there was work that he
should finish this afternoon. The old darky
was backing the horse. The minister and
the ladies were approaching.</p>

<p>The young fellow was just in from a sail,
having been down to the sedge land with his
gun, but he would go again. He gave a call.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Pete; go on with the ditching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes were indifferent as he watched
the approach, though their glance was
straight and clear and keen. Suddenly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
look changed, intensified, and the young fellow&rsquo;s
shoulders squared.</p>

<p>The minister led the way, talking with the
pretty, slight woman, who stopped with protest
every step as her feet went down in sand.
Behind them came a jaunty-looking girl
with light-footed carriage. The wind was
ruffling and tossing her hair and she held to
her hat as she stopped under the orange
trees to look upon the prospect.</p>

<p>But the eyes watching her did not turn,
knowing the scene on which she was gazing.
It was Lake Nancy, long and lizard-like&mdash;its
sapphire water shimmering beneath the
breeze&mdash;stretching westward between curving,
twisting, inletted shores, fringed near at
hand with the bright green of young oranges
and lemons, and farther on by the darker
live-oak and pine, while on the opposite
side the line of forest stretched heavy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
sombre, trailing grey moss hoariness into
Nancy&rsquo;s lapping wave.</p>

<p>And while the girl gazed on Nancy the
young man watched her with a curious intentness
but with no doubt. Then he
walked in the length of the pier to meet
them. As the girl&rsquo;s eyes came round to him
she changed to a startled pallor, white as her
serge gown, and her eyes dilated, then into
them came eagerness.</p>

<p>Except for a tightening pull on muscles
about nose and mouth the young fellow
stood impassive.</p>

<p>The colour rushed back into the girl&rsquo;s face.
The young man had turned and was shaking
hands with Mr. Henderson. The minister
was mentioning names, too, but the girl
had her back to them and was studying the
outstretch. Her head was high.</p>

<p>When she turned again Mr. Henderson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
was carefully piloting the other lady into the
boat. &ldquo;Malise,&rdquo; that lady was calling.
Malise, forced by this to come and be helped
in, found herself in the stern. But her
throat, because of a choked-back sob, hurt,
and a vast homesickness and sense of futility
was upon her.</p>

<p>When presently she could look up and
around the little craft was skimming out
across the lake to deep water, where it
shifted westward and flew into the dying
afternoon.</p>

<p>There were billowy puffs of clouds high
above, softly flushing into rose with a golden
fleeciness to their edges. Her mother&rsquo;s talk
and dulcet-toned laughter reached the girl,
punctuated with the serious accents of
Mr. Henderson. The two were sitting
where the seats, running about, came together
at the bow, and he, with an elbow on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
the rail, was looking at Molly. Such a wistful,
pretty child she looked in her white canvas
dress, with her wind-blown, gauzy veil
fluttering from her hat.</p>

<p>Alexina&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on them, but she
was conscious, too, of a gaze on her, which
for all her hot pride and hurt she could not
look around and meet. Once, when the
sail was shifting and she knew the eyes
would, perforce, be concerned therewith, she
stole a hurried survey and saw a well-knit
figure, quick in its movements, the muscles
playing beneath the flannel shirt. A discarded
coat was upon the seat near her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down, please,&rdquo; came in cool, deliberate
tones from the owner of the coat and the
gaze. The head of the girl went down, while
the sail swung about. The boat dipped,
righted, then flew ahead, following the curving
shores of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
The very air seemed flushing, the shimmering
water had a thousand tints, the
shores slipping by breathed out odours of
mould, and leaf and vine. The western sky
was triumphing, clouds of purple and of
crimson lifting one above another about a
golden centre. And they in the boat were
speeding into the glory; the very rosiness of
the air seemed stealing down upon them and
enveloping them. The sense of avoirdupois,
of gravitation, was lost; one felt winged,
uplifted; it was good all at once, it was good
to live, to be.</p>

<p>The eyes and the gaze were on her again;
she felt them and turned suddenly and faced
them. The look she met was deep and
warm, but it changed, holding hers, grew cool,
enigmatical, impersonal. Did he not know
her then, or did he not want to know her?</p>

<p>This time tears of hurt and pride rushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
to her eyes. He was watching, but she
could not get her eyes away, even with those
hateful tears welling.</p>

<p>The sail shifted, for no reason apparently.
&ldquo;Down, please,&rdquo; he commanded. But as
the boat dipped, shook itself, righted again,
and flew on through the rosy light, his head
came up near hers and his voice, in the old,
boyish way, said: &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sudden light shone through the tears in
the girl&rsquo;s eyes. Molly would have wrung
her hands with an artist&rsquo;s anguish, this was
the place for coquetry!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t want to know me
and I was hurt,&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was yours to know first,&rdquo; said Willy
Leroy stoutly, but his eyes were laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina, doubtfully; &ldquo;why,
yes; perhaps it was.&rdquo; And then she laughed,
too, gaily.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>


<p>As Molly, Alexina and Mr. Henderson sat
on the front gallery of the hotel the next
morning, they were joined by one Mr.
Thompson Jonas, a lawyer of Aden, who
lived above his office and took his meals at
the hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas was small, wiry and muscular,
of Georgia stock, with a fierce little air and a
fierce moustache, and quick, bright blue eyes,
never still. He had sprung to the aid of
Molly and Alexina one morning and flung a
door open as they passed from the dining-room,
and speedily they were all good
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
It was characteristic of him that he should
have flung the door back, not merely opened
it. There was something of homage in
the act. Within the body of the little man
was the chivalrous spirit of a Chevalier
Bayard, a C&oelig;ur de Lion. The big soul
of Mr. Jonas was imprisoned in his pigmy
person as the spirit of the genius in the
casket.</p>

<p>He was a Nimrod, too, and even now
stood in hunting accoutrements, seeming
rather to have been shaken into his natty
leggings than they to have been drawn onto
him, and there was a flare and dip to his
wide, soft hat and a jaunty fling to his knotted
tie. His dog, a Gordon setter bitch, sat
on her haunches by him as he stood, his fingers
playing with her silky ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;d better come go with me,
Henderson,&rdquo; he was urging, &ldquo;the buggy&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
here at the door and you need it&mdash;you need
this sort of thing more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a busy day with me, thank you,&rdquo;
answered the Reverend Henderson a little
coldly, for this Mr. Jonas was a man of no
church. His faith, he had frequently assured
the young clergyman, would long ago
have died for breathing space in any creed
he yet had met with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re older you&rsquo;ll understand
better what I mean, my dear boy,&rdquo; the little
man had in good part and cheerfulness assured
the other. &ldquo;Come around and use
my books any time you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the soul of Mr. Jonas enthused&mdash;or
convinced its owner that it did&mdash;over Confucius,
and further revelled in the belief that
it delved in occult knowledge; it also led
him to place the volumes of the early Fathers
on his book-shelves and the literature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
of the Saints and of Kant and Comte and
Swedenborg; it conducted its owner to the
feet of Emerson and Thoreau; it made him
talk Darwinism. Jesus Christ and Plato,
Mr. Jonas loved to say, made up his ideal
philosophy.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson, on the other hand, spoke
of church buildings in Aden other than his
own as assembling places. It was inevitable
he did not give his approval to Mr. Jonas.
His feeling against the little man even
made him enumerate the occupations ahead
for the day, as if it was a sort of avowal of
the faith to thus declare them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a busy day with me, thank you. I
have a feast day service and a guild meeting,
besides my parochial duties and a vestry
meeting for the evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Molly, looking at him.
&ldquo;To be sure&mdash;I&rsquo;d forgotten you&rsquo;re a minister.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
The young man looked up, instant
self-arraignment in his face, for permitting
it to be forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you have service?&rdquo; Molly was
saying. &ldquo;We must come over, Malise
and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told her gravely.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas was standing against the gallery
railing, rising and falling on his neat
little toes, the setter&rsquo;s eyes following his every
movement. He was facing Mrs. Garnier
and her daughter, looking from the
mother, with her red-brown hair and shadowy
lashes, to the girl, quite lovely, also,
when she smiled in this sweet, sudden way
up at him. She had nice hair, too, something
the colour of wild honey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming women, charming women,&rdquo;
he was summing them up.</p>

<p>Yet could Mr. Jonas have called to mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
any women, the old or young, the forlorn
or charming, who had not moved him to
chivalric emotion in some form?</p>

<p>Alexina was looking up the street. Mr.
Jonas turned, too, as a wagonette, drawn by
two big, iron-grey mules, swung round the
corner, a glitter of brass and a hint of red
about the harness. A young fellow on the
front seat was driving; a lady sat behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The finest boy and best shot in Jasmine
County,&rdquo; said Mr. Jonas, starting forward
as the mules were reined up at the hotel entrance,
&ldquo;and the foolishest, most profoundly
wise mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina was going forward, too. &ldquo;We&mdash;that
is, I know them,&rdquo; she told him; &ldquo;they
are old friends, the Leroys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For she had known Charlotte in a moment.</p>

<p>A darky boy lounging about came to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
the mules and Willy sprang his mother out,
as lightly as ever a girl would spring, and
brought her up the steps to Alexina.</p>

<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s embrace was eager and ardent;
then she cried a little, with her face
against the girl&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my youth,&rdquo; she said the next instant,
lifting her head and smiling at the
girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost a middle-aged woman,
little Mab; I&rsquo;m nearly forty-five and I don&rsquo;t
want to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vivacity, as of old, dwelt in Charlotte&rsquo;s
face and animated her lively movements,
but her brilliant eyes were somewhat
sunken, as happens with women of
marked features and dashing beauty; the
skin was growing sallow too, and as the
cheeks and temples drew in the features
stood large.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to grow old,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
Charlotte, and truthfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how to let go. I haven&rsquo;t the resourcefulness,
or quiet, or repose, for an old woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Always, &rsquo;way back as Charlotte Ransome,
she had loved the showy, and she loved it
still, as evidenced by the scarlet ribbon from
which her fan hung, and the flowered muslin,
showing the hand of village dressmaking.
But she bore herself with the smiling
pleasure of a child in them.</p>

<p>Willy joined them. He had been talking
with Mr. Jonas, and evidently had declined
the expedition too, for the little man, calling
to the setter, went off grumbling and upbraiding
the lot of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came early to avoid the heat,&rdquo; Charlotte
explained, as they went to join Molly
and Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s eyes swept Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s youthful
fineries wonderingly, curiously. It was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
credit to Molly that her sixth sense lay in an
instinctive selection of the appropriate in the
beautiful. She wondered much as a child
wonders over the mysterious, at what she
more often than not saw on others.</p>

<p>She lolled back now in her simple dress,
of which Alexina had reason to know the
cost, and she lolled indifferently&mdash;Celeste
or some one would press out the rumples
when need be&mdash;then she held out a pretty
hand to Charlotte.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Leroy, the greetings over, spread
her draperies with some care and absorption
as she sat down. She was another type
of helpless person, the reverse of Molly, with
a carping sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s gaze followed her concern with
lazy interest in which lurked laughter, for
the dress upon which the care was bestowed
was so, well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
Alexina&rsquo;s face grew hot; she hated Molly,
whose every thought she was reading; and,
by the girl&rsquo;s arrangement, they fell into
two groups, Molly and the men making one,
King William perched on the railing of the
gallery, and Alexina and Mrs. Leroy the
other, drawn a little apart. There was so
much to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We see the Kentucky papers,&rdquo; Charlotte
told Alexina, &ldquo;so I know of most of the
happenings.&rdquo; She drew a little breath.
&ldquo;And Austen Blair is married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;just before we
came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte was regarding her like a child
with a secret trembling on its lips. &ldquo;I was
engaged to him once, Alexina, and we broke
it.&rdquo; Light from many sides began to break
in upon Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Mrs. Leroy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;He
was the only man ever caring for me that I
never subjugated&mdash;except Willy here&mdash;&rdquo; Her
voice brightened, while she nodded, in
her near-sighted way, at Mr. Henderson.
&ldquo;As for him, he&rsquo;s ruled me and browbeat
me all his life.&rdquo; And Charlotte smiled contentedly
at the minister.</p>

<p>Alexina reached out and, with a passionate
sort of protectingness, took hold of the
beringed hand wielding a fan with vivacity
and sprightliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we could have given him more
advantages,&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy was continuing;
&ldquo;but he&rsquo;s had to plan for us somehow instead.
I remember he wasn&rsquo;t eleven years
old, though it seemed natural enough he
should be doing it at the time, when we came
over from St. Louis to Louisville without
his father, and Willy had to buy the tickets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
and check the trunks. I suppose I ought
to have realized it, but I never had done
such things in my life, and I lost my purse in
the depot, I remember, and a gentleman
found it, and so Willy took hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We sent him into town here, after we
came to Aden, to the Presbyterian minister,
who taught him. He wanted to go to college,
not that he&rsquo;d admit it now. Then as
soon as he was any size he began at his father
about reclaiming the grove. That is,
Willy planned and Georges listened. Willy&rsquo;d
got an idea from Mr. Jonas that the railroad
was coming through some day, just as
it has, but it&rsquo;s been a long pull and a wait, for
this is the first full yield for his trees. He&rsquo;s
been offered seven thousand for the crop as
it hangs, but the mortgage is eight thousand
on the place, which went for fertilizing and
ditching and sheds, and living, you know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
so Willy is holding for eight thousand and
Mr. Jonas is urging for nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s pride in these statements was
beaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as the grove proves itself, the
place will sell for several times its old value,
and we&rsquo;re going back to Kentucky, to
Woodford. Willy wants to buy back my
father&rsquo;s farm, not that he&rsquo;ll let me say that
he does, he&rsquo;s so afraid of admitting anything,
but when he was nineteen, three years ago,
he had the measles&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it dear and
comical, like he was a child again&mdash;and he
let me hold his hand, in the dark room, you
know, and we talked about it, when we
would go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl was patting Charlotte&rsquo;s hand
softly and winking back tears while she
laughed. Why tears? She herself had no
idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
Mrs. Leroy had a thousand questions to
ask, she said, but somehow she never got to
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;we have
to go and I&rsquo;ve talked of nothing but my own
affairs. In my solitude down here I&rsquo;ve
grown a shameless egotist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if she had been ever anything else, the
unconscious soul!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to be with one of my own sex&mdash;some
one linked with the past, too, is extenuation.
There&rsquo;s so much a woman can&rsquo;t
talk of with men, they have such different
ways of seeing things, and let her love her
men folk never so dearly, if there&rsquo;s none of
her own sex around, a woman&rsquo;s lonesome,
Alexina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;she is.&rdquo; But she
said it absently, for she was conscious of
King William&rsquo;s gaze being upon her. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
looked up laughing, yet a little confused, for
his look was warm.</p>

<p>He slipped along the railing, leaving Mrs.
Garnier and the minister chatting. In this
blue serge suit and straw hat he looked very
like the King William of long ago, dark, keen
and impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, Aden?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; said Alexina. &ldquo;Somehow as
soon as you are in a thing the scene changes
to out of doors. It used to be Indians on
the common, or Crusoe in the yard, back
there in Louisville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You began by saying you liked it,&rdquo; he
reminded her. Did he think to tease? His
eyes were naughty. Here was a zest; this
was no Georgy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I do,&rdquo; she said, standing to it. &ldquo;I
do like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
Was he always laughing at people, this
William Leroy?</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are coming to spend a day with us
this week, Alexina and her mother,&rdquo; Mrs.
Leroy here told her son, at which, for all the
imperturbability of his countenance, Alexina
was conscious of something a little less
happy about the son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very good to come,&rdquo; he responded.
The tone might be called guarded.</p>

<p>Certain recollections were crowding upon
Alexina. Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s management, her
housekeeping, even to a child&rsquo;s comprehension,
had been palpably erratic and unexpected.</p>

<p>The girl understood his masculine helplessness.
Hers were the eyes that laughed
now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve set the table in your house before,&rdquo;
she informed him, &ldquo;while you made toast.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
His countenance cleared. He met her
gaze solemnly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What day, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night Alexina was chatting with Mr.
Jonas. She liked him. &ldquo;You said this
morning,&rdquo; she reminded him, &ldquo;that Mrs.
Leroy was the wisest, foolishest mother&mdash;what
did you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said Mr. Jonas. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t
her very incompetency made the boy?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER THREE</h3>


<p>For the next three days Mr. Henderson
avoided them. He spoke in the hall or dining-room,
to be sure, but joined them no
more in plans or on the gallery.</p>

<p>And Molly turned petulant. Why had they
ever come to Aden, she moaned. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
propose something, Malise?&rdquo; she besought.</p>

<p>Alexina, endeavouring to write letters, felt
tired. She had been up at Molly&rsquo;s call a
dozen times in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to spend to-morrow with
Mrs. Leroy,&rdquo; she reminded her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks like Mrs. Malaprop,&rdquo; said
Molly crossly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
The daughter&rsquo;s face flushed. Youth is
rawly sensitive to ridicule of its friends.
Besides, what would they find at Lake
Nancy? It would be poor, she expected
that, and it might be&mdash;pitiful? Not to her,
not to her, but Molly was so unable to see
behind things. If a thing was poor to Molly
it was only poor and she said so. Alexina
hoped her mother would not go.</p>

<p>But when Friday came Molly, in feverish,
restless state, was ready for anything and
even brightened up over it, while it was
Alexina who was petulant, and put on one
dress and took it off, and tried another, even
with William Leroy down-stairs in the wagonette,
waiting.</p>

<p>But she felt better as she came out into
the sunshine and the dress she had finally
decided on seemed to settle on her into sudden
jauntiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
William shook hands. There was a comfortable
sense of humour about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair to divide families into component
parts on occasions,&rdquo; he stated, and put
Alexina in a place by his own and Molly behind.
Molly pouted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, besides, we are going to drop Henderson
at a sick parishioner&rsquo;s on the way,&rdquo;
he said, with a naughty glance at her. &ldquo;I
met him starting to the livery stable just now
and stopped him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s face cleared. She met his eyes
with insouciance, but, somehow, one felt all
at once that she liked him better.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson came out with a satchel and
climbed in. He looked stern and uninviting,
Alexina thought, but the note of Molly&rsquo;s
random remarkings promptly brightened.
Willy flicked the whip above the big grey span
and off they trotted across town, westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
The morning was keen enough that the
sun&rsquo;s warmth was pleasant and quickened
the blood. Aden was left behind. Here and
there on the outskirts frame houses, crudely
and hideously cheap, were building. Land
everywhere was being cleared, the felled trees
lying about, the whirl of a portable sawmill
telling their destiny, while burning stumps
filled the air with creosote pungency.</p>

<p>Then the despoilments of progress were
left behind and the untouched pine woods
closed about them, and trees rose tall,
straight, twigless, to where a never-ceasing
murmur soughed, and the light came sifting,
speckled, and flickering through the gloom,
upon the sandy ground and scrub palmetto
beneath.</p>

<p>Alexina breathed deep. It was quiet,
and peaceful and solemn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said William sociably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
She looked up; she hadn&rsquo;t spoken.</p>

<p>The trees thinned, grew sparse, and the
road came out into the open. A mile farther
on they entered a belt of hummock land,
a wild growth of live-oak, cypress, magnolias,
thicketed, intertwisted, rank. Grey
moss trailed and swept their faces as they
passed under, vines clambered and swung
and festooned, gophers crawled out of the
path, and a gleaming snake slid across the
road and into the palmetto undergrowth.</p>

<p>He was looking at her as they came out,
she flushed and ecstatic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;until I show it to
you after a while in bloom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just beyond the hummock he drew rein
at a clearing before an unpainted frame
house, even cheaper and more hideous than
the most. Mr. Henderson got out, King
handing the satchel after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a death-bed,&rdquo; he said under his
breath to the two, as the minister went toward
the house; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the pitiful part of it
down here, people taking all they&rsquo;ve got to
get here, only to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell about it,&rdquo; said Molly
sharply.</p>

<p>William Leroy touched the mules and
they went on. A little later Alexina felt
Molly&rsquo;s hand upon her. &ldquo;Come back with
me, Malise,&rdquo; she begged. Her face looked
drawn and grey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; explained King, and a
minute after turned in at an old iron gate,
flanked by two ancient live-oaks. An osage
hedge, cut back upon its woody stock,
stretched about the place either side from
the gate. Within, the driveway made a
sweep off towards buildings in the rear, while
a shell path led up to the house, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
of frame, wide, with porches across the front,
up-stairs and down. Bermuda grass covered
the sandy surface of the yard, which was
large and sloped back towards the lake, visible
through the grove. Here and there a
banana plant reared its ragged luxuriance
and a stunted palm or two struggled upward;
there was on old rustic seat beneath
a gnarled wild orange tree.</p>

<p>As Willy helped them out, Charlotte appeared
and came animatedly down the path
between the borders of crepe myrtle. Alexina
ran ahead to meet her. The girl&rsquo;s hands
were quite cold. Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s white dress,
relic of bygone fashion, fluttered with rose-coloured
ribbons, and suddenly Alexina
seemed to see a wide old cottage in a shrub-grown
yard, and on its porch a lady in a
gauzy dress with rosy ribbons, gathering a
little child into her lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
The girl threw her arms about this Charlotte
in the old white dress, and then, because
her eyes were full of foolish tears, ran
on, for the Captain was on the porch, in a
cane arm-chair, a line of blue smoke trailing
up from the cigar in his fingers. Laughing
and breathless she went up the steps and
their eyes met. Never a word spoke either,
but the hand of the man closed on the girl&rsquo;s
and rested there until the others came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willy wouldn&rsquo;t let me do a thing about
your coming, Alexina,&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy began,
as she reached them; &ldquo;he said he&rsquo;d tend to
it himself and wouldn&rsquo;t let me give a direction.
He&rsquo;s fussy sometimes and notionate,
like the time when the surveyors were staying
with us, and Mandy set some dishes on a
chair. I&rsquo;d already told him she didn&rsquo;t
know how to clear a table for dessert, and
he said I ought to have taught her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
The girl&rsquo;s eyes danced. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all of
you the same, the very same; not one of
the three has changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte beamed. She took it with undisguised
pleasure that she had not changed.</p>

<p>King came round the house. He had
taken the mules to the stable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding
you to that bargain,&rdquo; he reminded
Alexina.</p>

<p>Molly looked bored. Such things were
only playful and interesting as she was
part of them. Then she said she was tired,
evidently having no mind for a morning with
Mrs. Leroy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall go up and lie down in my
room,&rdquo; said Charlotte.</p>

<p>The three women went in. The hall dividing
the house was wide and high, its floor
of boards a foot wide, and bare but for a
central strip of carpet; an old mahogany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
hat-tree stood against one wall, a mahogany sofa
against the other, with straight backed
chairs flanking both. It was all labouriously
clean and primly bare.</p>

<p>The rooms up-stairs were big, with old
mahogany furniture set squarely about
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t want me to bring the furniture,
Willy and his father, when we came,&rdquo;
Charlotte told Alexina; &ldquo;it cost more to get
it here than to buy new, but I didn&rsquo;t want
new; I wanted this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything was innocent of covers or
hangings, nor were there any pictures. She
explained this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to drive nails,&rdquo; she
told them, &ldquo;and Willy and the Captain don&rsquo;t
care. Willy had the house papered this
fall in case of people coming about buying,
and the papering men took the nails out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
walls and he won&rsquo;t bother to put them in.
They&rsquo;re all in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte didn&rsquo;t mean the nails; she threw
open a closet door and ancestral Ransomes,
neatly set against the walls, peered out of
the dark.</p>

<p>Alexina put a hand over Charlotte&rsquo;s on
the door knob. Molly yawned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems chilly here in my room,&rdquo; said
Charlotte; &ldquo;the sun isn&rsquo;t round this side
yet. Put your hats on the bed and Mrs.
Garnier shall go lie on Willy&rsquo;s sofa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They followed her across the hall. &ldquo;He
has his bed and things in there,&rdquo; she explained,
nodding towards an adjoining room,
&ldquo;and he keeps his books and such in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the floor, otherwise uncarpeted, lay a
bearskin. There was a sofa against the
wall and a plain deal table in the centre of
the room, piled with papers, books and pipes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
about a lamp. There were some chairs; a
gun-rack, antlers, an alligator skin and
some coloured prints of English hunting
scenes on the walls, and an old-fashioned,
brass-mounted cellarette hung in an angle.
The south window looked out across the
grove upon Nancy; between the two east
windows stood an old secretary book-case.</p>

<p>Charlotte suggesting that Mrs. Garnier
put on a wrapper, the two went back to her
bed-room. Alexina stood hesitating. She
felt a sense of surreptitiousness and embarrassment,
and then took a step to the book-case&mdash;any
one might do that much&mdash;and
read the titles of the books.</p>

<p>About orange culture and fertilizing these
first seemed to be, and those next were concerned
with the breeding of stock. They
meant Woodford and the future, probably.
She skipped to the other shelves. Buckle&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
Introduction to the History of Civilization,
Hallam&rsquo;s Middle Ages, Wealth of Nations,
Wilhelm Meister, Poems of Heinrich
Heine, several volumes of Spencer and Huxley,
Slaves of Paris, Lecocq, the Detective,
File No. 118, The Lerouge Case, The Scotland
Yard Detective, Carlyle&rsquo;s French
Revolution, Taxidermitology, Renan&rsquo;s Life
of Jesus, Pole on Whist, Hoyle, Tom Sawyer,
Past and Present, Pickwick Papers, Herodotus,
an unbroken shelf of Walter Scott, A
Pair of Blue Eyes, Cousin Pons, Drainage,
Pendennis, Small Fruit Culture.</p>

<p>Why, here was a world, within these glass
doors, she did not know. Yet she had read
diligently among Uncle Austen&rsquo;s books.
She looked back in memory over his shelves;
Macaulay, yes, Uncle Austen cared so essentially
for Macaulay, and for Bancroft and
Prescott, and Whittier and Lowell. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
were the standards in fiction and poetry in
well-bound sets. Uncle Austen himself admired
Alexander Pope, and Franklin&rsquo;s Autobiography;
he liked Charles Reade&rsquo;s
novels, too, bearing on institutional reforms&mdash;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Leroy and Molly came back,
Molly in a white wrapper and Charlotte
bearing a pillow and a silk quilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willy&rsquo;s calling,&rdquo; Charlotte told Alexina;
&ldquo;he wants you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was at the foot of the stairs, and, waiting
for her to get down, watched her hand on
the banister. The wood was dark and the
hand was white and slender. Then he held
out a big, checked apron. She walked into
it and looked over her shoulder while he
tied the strings behind.</p>

<p>It takes time to set a table when neither is
just certain where things are to be found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
Hunting together in sideboard, cupboards,
and on pantry shelves brings about a feeling
of knowing each other very well. There
was so much, too, to talk about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember&mdash;&rdquo; it was Alexina
pausing with a goblet in hand to ask it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you forgot&mdash;&rdquo; King, producing a
carving set, would rejoin.</p>

<p>Presently she paused. Twice she started
to speak, hesitated, then said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a thing I want to ask you, or, rather, want
to say&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice was a little tremulous
and breathless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember&mdash;that is, you haven&rsquo;t
forgot the &lsquo;King William&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was looking away from him and he
looking at her, his mouth odd, yet smiling,
too. She was an honest and a pleasant
thing to look upon. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
well as I remember the raft we put off on
from the desert island and the plains back of
the stable&mdash;have you forgotten the trackless
plains where we sat down to starve in
the snow, with never a sign of deer or buffalo
for days, or even a thing on wing? We&rsquo;d
just lighted on Hiawatha those days. There
was an Indian, by the way, came up from
the grass water yesterday and brought us
venison for to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was evident he did not mean to let her
return to the subject.</p>

<p>Presently Alexina untied the apron. &ldquo;I
must see your mother some,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she does not want you,&rdquo; declared his
mother&rsquo;s son; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s overjoyed to think
you&rsquo;re with me. She thinks there is something
deficient in her son; she insists I&rsquo;ve
never spoken to a girl since we left you in
Louisville. Besides, she&rsquo;s in the kitchen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
I hear her out there now, all fluttered herself
and fluttering Aunt Mandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexina would go. &ldquo;I must call
Molly in time for dinner,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOUR</h3>


<p>Now William Leroy supposed Mrs. Garnier
to be in his mother&rsquo;s room. A moment later
he followed Alexina up the stairs, meaning
to get something out of his desk which he
wished to show her. He was a most direct
youth, considering that he was, by his mother&rsquo;s
confession, a timorous one. There was
an odd little smile about his mouth, perhaps
because all things looked pleasant right now.</p>

<p>His nature was practical rather than sanguine,
and built in general only on things
achieved, but to-day the fruit was hanging
golden on the trees and the grove was one
of the few new ones in bearing. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
anticipated the railroad by several years in
planting, and now the grove and house were
going to bring a figure larger than he ever
had hoped for.</p>

<p>As the Israelites yearned for Canaan, he
was looking towards the pastoral lands of
Kentucky. To-day, for the once, he would
let this new buoyancy, this unanalyzed optimism
run warm in his blood; why not?
He was young, he was strong, he was master
of his circumstances for the first time.</p>

<p>He went up the steps lightly, springily,
with a sort of exuberant joy in the mere
action. His canvas shoes made no sound.
The stairs landed him at his own door. He
brought up short.</p>

<p>Alexina was standing midway of the
threshold; he thought he heard a sob.</p>

<p>She turned hurriedly, her hands outspread
across the doorway as by instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged; &ldquo;please go away.&rdquo;
Then as he wheeled, &ldquo;No, wait&mdash;&rdquo; She
swallowed before she could speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Molly,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;can you send us
back to town? she&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not well,&rdquo; the daughter was trying to
say. The boy&rsquo;s straightforward eyes were
fixed on hers inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use; I can&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; the girl
broke down miserably. &ldquo;I ought not to
have come with her.&rdquo; Her arms dropped
from across the doorway. In all perplexity
he was waiting. He had a glimpse of Molly
within, drooping against the table, and her
eyes regarding them with a kind of furtive
fear.</p>

<p>His hunting flask from out the cellarette
was there on the table.</p>

<p>The girl was speaking with effort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry; she must have felt bad and found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
She suddenly hid her face in her hands
against the casement.</p>

<p>That roused him. He felt dazed. It
needed a woman here to feel the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get mother,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; begged the girl, and quivered;
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t we get back to town without&mdash;must
she know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>King was growing himself again. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;of all people, yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went down the steps two at a time.
There was no sensitive apprehension in his
manner when he brought her back, as there
often was concerning his mother; he knew
her strength as well as her incompetencies.</p>

<p>She came straight up and hardly noticed
Alexina as she passed but went on to Molly,
whose eyes, full of shame and fear, were
dully watching the scene.</p>

<p>Charlotte put her arms about her, drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
her to the sofa, and sat by her. &ldquo;Poor
dear,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;poor dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly drooped, trembled, then turned and
clung to her, crying piteously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sorry
for me? I did it because I&rsquo;m afraid. He
said they all come down here to die. Malise
don&rsquo;t know, she don&rsquo;t understand, she&rsquo;s
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go down to your dinner, Alexina,&rdquo;
said Charlotte; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s waiting. Oh, yes,
yes you will go.&rdquo; There was finality in the
tone, very different from Charlotte&rsquo;s usually
indefinite directions. &ldquo;Leave your mother
to me; oh, you needn&rsquo;t tell me anything
about it; I know. And take that hardness
out of your face, Alexina, it&rsquo;s your own
fault if you let this embitter you, it&rsquo;s ourselves
that let things spoil our lives, not the
things. I&rsquo;ll tell you something, that you
may believe I know, something that I told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
Willy at a time his arrogance seemed to
need the knowledge. My father, my great,
splendid, handsome father, all my life was
this way. But he came straight home to
my mother, and so she kept him from
worse, and held him to his place in the
world. Keep on loving them, it&rsquo;s the only
way. Many a time we&rsquo;ve all cried together
like babies, father and mother and I, by
her sofa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willy,&rdquo; called Charlotte. The boy ran
up from below. &ldquo;Take Alexina down to
her dinner and afterwards take her out of
doors. No, you&rsquo;re not going back to the
hotel, not to-night. Willy can send Peter in
for your woman and your things, for you&rsquo;re
going to stay here till she&rsquo;s better and you see
this thing differently.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">That evening King and Alexina sat on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
edge of the pier, the water lapping the posts
beneath their swinging feet. He was peeling
joints of sugar-cane and handing her
sections on the blade of his knife, she trying
to convince herself that they were as toothsome
as he insisted they were. He could
idle like a child.</p>

<p>But the girl&rsquo;s mind was back there in the
house. &ldquo;According to your mother,&rdquo; she
was saying, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s got to be affection back
of the doing of a duty.&rdquo; Poor child, she was
putting it so guardedly, so impersonally she
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, dropping his unappreciated
bits of cane, piece by piece into the
water, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s way of looking at
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked the girl, at that,
&ldquo;how does a man do hard things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He just does &rsquo;em, I should say, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
doesn&rsquo;t analyze. He&rsquo;s got to be at something,
you know; it&rsquo;s part of the creed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What creed?&rdquo; demanded Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jonas&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;yes, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIVE</h3>


<p>Molly, Alexina and Celeste stayed a week at
Nancy with the Leroys. It was a household
wherein there was no strain, no tension,
though, to be sure, there was small management.
One had a comical comprehension
that Mandy the cook and Tina the wash-woman
kept their families off the gullibility
and good faith of their mistress.</p>

<p>Alexina was sent into the sunshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her outdoors,&rdquo; Charlotte commanded
Willy; &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s morbid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas drove out with trophies of game
as offerings to Mrs. Garnier. One morning
Mr. Henderson came with him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
buckboard, and Molly and the two men sat in the
sunshine on the porch and talked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he die?&rdquo; she asked the minister
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man at the house where you stopped
that day?&rdquo; She asked it as one driven to
know, even while apprehensive of the answer.</p>

<p>Exultation leaped for an instant to the
young man&rsquo;s face, a stern joy. &ldquo;He died,&rdquo;
he told her, &ldquo;but in the faith at the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what faith?&rdquo; Molly asked curiously.
She was a child in so many things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Church,&rdquo; he told her, with reproof
in his tone.</p>

<p>The click of Mr. Jonas&rsquo;s incisors upon
incisors chopped the air.</p>

<p>But Molly moved a little nearer the minister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed slowly, unwillingly almost;
&ldquo;they all do. Father Bonot used to
say it over and over. They all come back
to the Church to&mdash;to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was shivering.</p>

<p>There was a quick, snapped off h&rsquo;ah from
Mr. Jonas.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson looked bewildered. &ldquo;I
did not know; then, Mrs. Garnier, you
are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Catholic,&rdquo; said Molly, a little in
wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Romanist?&rdquo; said the other gently.</p>

<p>But Molly wasn&rsquo;t listening, nor would she
have known what the distinction meant,
had she been. It was Mr. Jonas who gave
forth another sound that was almost a snort,
and marched off to where King and Alexina
were sitting on the step.</p>

<p>Molly watched him go, then glanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
around as if to insure aloofness, and leaned
forward, her fingers pulling at the edge of
her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You helped him to die, and you&rsquo;re a
priest&mdash;one sort of a priest&mdash;and I want
to tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;you do not understand;
let me make you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Molly; &ldquo;no,&rdquo;
hurriedly, &ldquo;let me tell you. I want to tell
you. It will help me. I take things&mdash;I
have to; anything that will make me forget
and make me sleep. I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I take it
because I&rsquo;m afraid to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her out of dull eyes. She
was, self-avowedly, everything he held
abhorrent&mdash;alien, worldly, and weak.
He stammered something&mdash;was he asking
God to help her, or himself?&mdash;and
left her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
Later, as he and Mr. Jonas drove back to
Aden, the eyes of Mr. Jonas snapped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re brewing mischief to your own or
somebody else&rsquo;s peace of mind; you always
are when you look like that. Out with it,
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why Mr. Henderson should out with it,
he himself knew less than any, but Mr.
Jonas had a way.</p>

<p>The minister&rsquo;s words came forth with
effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seeking light to know why
Mrs. Garnier was sent down here. I&rsquo;ve
never cared for a woman before; I can&rsquo;t
seem to tear it out. But to-day it&rsquo;s made
clear: she was sent to me to be saved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From her faith?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Jonas.</p>

<p>But the minister was impervious to the
sarcasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the faith,&rdquo; said Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
The others gone, Alexina, King William
and the Captain sat on the porch. The girl
who was on the step reached up and put a
hand on the locket swinging from the Captain&rsquo;s
fob. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;I used
to, often, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain slipped the watch out and
handed it to her, the rest depending, and she
opened the locket, a large, thin, plain gold
affair. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, bending over it,
then looking up at the Captain archly, &ldquo;this
is Julie Piquet, your mother, wife of Aristide
Leroy, refugee and Girondist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She recited it like a child proud of knowing
its lesson, then regarded him out of the
corners of her eyes, laughing.</p>

<p>There answered the faintest flicker of a
smile somewhere in the old Roman face.</p>

<p>The girl returned to the study of the dark
beauty on the ivory again, its curly tresses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
fillet bound, its snowy breasts the more revealed
than hidden by the short-waisted,
diaphanous drapery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And because it had been your father&rsquo;s
locket, with you and your mother in it, Mrs.
Leroy wouldn&rsquo;t let you change it to put her
in; and so this on the other side is you,
young Georges Gautier Hippolyte Leroy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Written G. Leroy in general,&rdquo; interpolated
the gentleman&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is how you looked at twenty,
dark and rosy-cheeked, with a handsome
aquiline nose. You never were democratic,
for all your grand pose at being; do you believe
he was?&rdquo; This to King. &ldquo;Look at
him here; if ever there was an inborn, inbred
aristocratic son of a revolutionist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He barricaded the streets of Paris with
his fellow-students in his turn, don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo;
said King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where his papa had sent him for a more
cosmopolitan knowledge of life than Louisville
could afford,&rdquo; supplemented Alexina
gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where he wrote verses to a little
dressmaker across the hall,&rdquo; said William.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Verses?&rdquo; said Alexina. &ldquo;Did he write
verses? I never heard about the verses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said the son; &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t he ever written
verses to you? Well, since I&rsquo;ve opened
the way to it, I was leading up to it all the
while, why <em>I have</em>. I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em to you.
I&rsquo;ve had &rsquo;em in my pocket waiting the opportunity
three days now.&rdquo; Which was true.
He had been going for them that first day.</p>

<p>He produced a small card photograph,
somewhat faded, which, taken in Alexina&rsquo;s
hand, showed her a little girl&rsquo;s serious face,
with short-cropped hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had a nice, straight little nose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
anyhow,&rdquo; said Alexina approvingly, studying
the card.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn it over,&rdquo; said William Leroy. He
had a way of commanding people. Some
day Alexina intended warring with him
about it, but she turned it over now. The
lines inscribed on its reverse were in a round
and laboured script that, despite effort, staggered
down hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said Willy Leroy, &ldquo;moi&mdash;myself,
with gulped-down tears at leaving
you. I&rsquo;ve never written any since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was reading them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out loud,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>

<p>She read them aloud. She was laughing,
but she was blushing absurdly, too.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<i>This is Alexina and she</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is a girl but she</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Plays like I tell her and she</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cried because we had to come away</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And this is Alexina.</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
&ldquo;He thinks, your son does,&rdquo; said Alexina,
addressing herself to the Captain, &ldquo;that he
was a precocious person, whereas he was
only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lamentably egotistical,&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said Willy, &ldquo;my picture
and my feelings thereon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;I want it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He said it with the King William
air. She made a little mouth, but gave
him the card, which he put back in his wallet
and the wallet into his pocket. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
welcome to a copy of the lines,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Alexina, bestowing on him a glance of
lofty disdain, departed, high-headed, into
the house.</p>

<p>But he ran after her and stooped, that he
might look into her face; was he laughing
at her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, and wheeled upon him,
but had to laugh too, such was the high
glee behind the sweet gravity on William Leroy&rsquo;s
countenance. Glee there was, yet,
too, something else in the dark eyes laughing
at her, something unconsciously warm
and caressing.</p>

<p>The girl ran quickly up-stairs.</p>

<p>And William Leroy, brought to himself,
stood where she left him. The hand on the
newel-post suddenly closed hard upon it,
then he straightened and walked into the
parlour, and, sitting down, stared at the embers
of the wood fire, as one bewildered.
Then his head lifted as with one who understands.
On his face was a strange look and
a light.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER SIX</h3>


<p>Alexina went up to her mother and Mrs.
Leroy. Molly was lolling in a big chair in
the sunshine, idly swinging the tassel of her
wrapper to and fro. The shadows about
her eyes were other than those lent by the
sweep of her childlike lashes, and she looked
wan. But she looked at peace, too. In
her present state the flow of Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s
personal chat was entertainment. Now,
there was always one central theme to Charlotte&rsquo;s
talk, whatever the variations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t a bit of false pride, Willy
hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she was stating. &ldquo;After his father
lost his position, those two years before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
trees began paying, there&rsquo;s nothing Willy
wouldn&rsquo;t turn his hand to. He carried a
chain for the surveyors and went as guide
for parties hunting and fishing in the
glades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly&rsquo;s attention sometimes wandered
from these maternal confidences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were Charlotte Ransome before you
were married, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked irrelevantly.
&ldquo;You used to come to New Orleans
winters, didn&rsquo;t you? You were at a
party at my Uncle Randolph&rsquo;s once when
I was a girl and you were spoken of as a
great beauty, I remember. There was a
pompon head-dress too, one winter, called
the Charlotte Ransome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Charlotte listening, only the vivacity
of smile and eyes left of her beauty, the
Charlotte living the obscure life of a little
raw Southern town, let her needle fall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
the needle she handled with the awkwardness
of a craft acquired late. She was darning
an old tablecloth, come down from her
mother&rsquo;s day, that day when triumphs and
adulation made up life, and when cost or
reckoning was a thing she troubled not herself
about. She was that Charlotte Ransome
again, called up by Mrs. Garnier, the
beauty, the fashion, and the belle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the joy of youth, the
joy! Old Madame d&rsquo;Arblay, the Louisville
milliner, devised that pompon head-dress
out of her own cleverness, and I remember
my old Aunt Polly Ann Love tried
to talk her down on the price. How it
comes back, the intoxication of it, and the
living. Drink deep, little Mab, it never
offers twice. I seemed to have divined it
never would be again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl looked from one woman to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
other. Molly still pursued this thing called
adulation, and Mrs. Leroy, big-hearted,
simple-souled as she was, looked yearningly
back on that which was gone.</p>

<p>Was this all, then? Was life forever after
empty, except as with Mrs. Leroy, of duties
that occupied but did not satisfy? And
what of women who are neither beauties nor
belles? What has life to offer them?</p>

<p>A vast depression came over the girl. And
was this all? Both women bore witness
that it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard tell in those days,&rdquo; Molly was
saying to Mrs. Leroy, &ldquo;of a dozen men in
the South you might have married. How
did you come&rdquo;&mdash;curiously&mdash;&ldquo;in the end
to marry Captain Leroy, so much older, and
so quiet, and&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte was too simple to resent the
question, which to her meant only affectionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
interest. Besides, she was an egotist,
and livened under talk of herself. She had
no concealment; indeed, had she been cognizant
of any skeleton in the family closet, it
must speedily have lost its gruesomeness to
her, so constantly would she have it out, annotating
its anatomy to any who showed interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he came to us in our trouble,&rdquo;
said Charlotte, &ldquo;to mother and me when
father died. He was shot, my father, you
know, in a political quarrel on the street in
Lexington, the year before the war. And
Captain Georges came to us. We&rsquo;d always
known him. His father and my Uncle Spottswood
Love operated the first brandy distillery
in Kentucky. Captain Georges had
brought me pretty things from New Orleans
and Paris all my life. I meant never to
marry, then; I&rsquo;d been unhappy. But it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
turned out we were poor, and so when
Georges said for me to marry him that he
might care for mother and me, why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; breathed Alexina. It was denunciation.
Certain scenes of childhood had
burned into her memory, which she had interpreted
later. Molly had not loved daddy,
either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one was ever so good, so nobly, generously
good to a woman as Georges has
been to me,&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy was saying; &ldquo;and
even in our poverty he and Willy have managed,
and kept it somehow from me, and
long, oh, long ago, I came to love him
dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young arraigner, hearing, gazed unconvinced.
She pushed the weight of her
hair back off her forehead, as she always did
when impatient. &ldquo;Came to love him dearly.&rdquo;
With that mere affection which grows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
from association, and dependence and habit.</p>

<p>The girl sitting on the window-sill in the
sunshine drew a long breath. There was
more in life than these two had found; all
unknowingly, they had proved it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER SEVEN</h3>


<p>Charlotte kept them with her the week, then
Molly turned restless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand hearing another thing
about Willy, Malise,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I
think he&rsquo;s a very dictatorial and outspoken
person myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Molly and Alexina and Celeste went
back to the hotel, which had filled during
the week of their absence. There was life
and bustle in the halls as they went in and,
from their windows up-stairs, they could see
the lake gay with sail-boats.</p>

<p>The talk down-stairs concerned dances,
picnics, fishing parties. The somnolent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
Molly awoke, languor fell from her and she
stepped to the centre of the gay little
whirl, the embodied spirit of festivity. Mr.
Henderson, incongruous element, was there,
too, with deliberate election it would seem,
for Molly&rsquo;s eyes did no inviting or encouraging.
She did not need him in capacity of
attendant or diverter these days, and it was
clear that in any other capacity he embarrassed
her. But he was not deterred because
of that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are coming to church, remember,&rdquo;
he told her on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Molly did not even play at archness with
him now; she looked timid. And at the
hour she went, and Alexina with her. They
had heard him officiate before, and it seemed
the mere performance of the law; but into
the dogmatic assertions of his discourse to-day
glowed that fire which is called inspiration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
The Reverend Henderson was living
these days.</p>

<p>Molly, slim and elegant in her finery,
moved once or twice in the pew. Alexina
could not quite tell if she was listening. But
she was. &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she said, from under
the shadow of her lace parasol, as they
walked home, &ldquo;how wearing it must be to
be so&mdash;er&mdash;intense.&rdquo; She spoke lightly,
but she shivered a little. The Reverend
Henderson had laid stress upon his text,
&ldquo;In the midst of life we are in death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they went up the hotel steps Molly
turned and looked around her and Alexina
turned too, since it was Molly&rsquo;s mood. The
sky was blue, the air breathed with life and
glow and sparkle. There was a taste almost
of sea about it. On the prim young orange
trees about the new houses across the street
the fruit hung golden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
&ldquo;He used to reach them for me&mdash;Father
Bonot did,&rdquo; said Molly, slowly, &ldquo;before I
was tall enough. They&rsquo;re sweeter&mdash;Louisiana
oranges are. I used to run and hide
behind his skirts, too, when I was afraid my
mother was going to whip me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went in. Half way up the stairs
Molly paused. &ldquo;You Blairs, you&rsquo;re all like
<em>him</em>&mdash;not like Father Bonot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like who?&rdquo; asked Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Mr. Henderson. You Blairs and
Mr. Henderson would have pulled aside
your skirts so my mother could have caught
me and whipped me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something like apprehension sprang into
Alexina&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said anxiously,
&ldquo;no; surely I&rsquo;m not like that, and Aunt
Harriet&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; said Molly stubbornly,
&ldquo;you all of you are. It&rsquo;s because&rdquo;&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
sort of childish rage seized on her&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
because you&rsquo;re all of you so&mdash;so damnably
sure of your duty.&rdquo; And Molly&rsquo;s foot
stamped the landing in her little fury.</p>

<p>It was funny, so funny that Alexina
laughed. And perhaps it was true. She
could have hugged Molly; she never came
so near to being fond of Molly before.</p>


<p class="hrpad">December arrived, Christmas came and
went. Life was almost pastoral&mdash;no,
hardly that; it was more <i>un fete champetre</i>.
Each day after breakfast the hotel emptied
itself into the sunshine and merriment, emptied
itself, that is, of all but the invalids.
Molly shunned these. She never even looked
the way of one if she could help it.</p>

<p>There was a lake party one night. They
took boat at the hotel pier in various small
craft and followed the chain of lakes to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
island midway of the farthest. The moon
was up as they started.</p>

<p>The party was of the gayest, and one
might have said that Mr. Henderson was
out of his element. Certainly his face was
hardly suggestive of hilarity. But he followed
Mrs. Garnier into one of the larger
boats and took his place with a sort of doggedness.
Even in the moonlight the sharpening
angle of his cheek-bone was visible,
and the deepening of the sockets in which
his eyes were set, eyes that followed Mrs.
Garnier insistently.</p>

<p>Molly being of the party, it followed that
Alexina was, too, but that William Leroy was
of it seemed to quicken something in his own
sense of humour. His manner with the gay
world was perhaps a little stony. He avowed,
when thus accused by Alexina and Mr.
Jonas, that it was to cover bashfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
&ldquo;I hate people,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

<p>Yet, for a bashful youth, he was singularly
deliberate and masterful, seeming to know
what he wanted and how to get it. To-night
it was that Alexina go with him in a
small boat. The others started first, a
youth in a striped flannel coat, strumming a
guitar.</p>

<p>King put out last. He rowed slowly and
often the boat drifted. When they entered
the lock connecting the first lake with the
next, the other boats had all passed through.
The moon scarcely penetrated the dense
foliage on the banks above them, and the
ripple of the water against the boat seemed
only to emphasize the silence, the aloofness.
There must have been an early blossom
of jasmine about, so sweet was the
gloom.</p>

<p>When they passed out into the vaulted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
space and open water of the next lake, the
other boats were far ahead. The tinkling
cadence of the guitar floated back to them.</p>

<p>He rowed lazily on. Presently he spoke.
&ldquo;I wonder if you remember how we used to
talk, &rsquo;way back yonder, about the Land of
Colchis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe we are there at last. We
closed the contract for our oranges to-day.
It&rsquo;s pretty fair gold, the fruit in Colchis.
We pick for delivery on Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He never had talked to her of personal
affairs before, it was Mrs. Leroy who had
told her what she knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are several purchasers looking at
the place we are going to sell, for dwellers in
Colchis, you know, are only sojourners;
they long for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Jasons, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
&ldquo;This Jason at any rate. He wants
four seasons to his year, and to hear his
horse&rsquo;s feet on pike, and to put his seed into
loam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They slipped through the next lock and
out upon the long length of Cherokee, the
lake of the island which was their destination.
It seemed to bring self-consciousness
upon the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so the same as you used to be,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I forget. How do I know you
want to hear all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do know,&rdquo; said Alexina, honestly.</p>

<p>He did not answer. They were coming up
to the other boats now, beached at the island.
Lights were flickering up and down the sand
and the rosy glare of a beach fire shone out
from under the darkness of the trees.
Figures were moving between it and them
and they could hear voices and laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
&ldquo;You do know,&rdquo; repeated the girl.</p>

<p>They had grounded. He was shipping
the oars. Then he got up and held out a
hand to steady her. She, standing, put hers
into it. They did not look at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do know. You&rsquo;re too
honest to pretend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped her along and out upon the
sand. There was a negro boy awaiting to
take charge of the boat. They went up the
slight declivity. He had not loosed her
hand, she had not withdrawn it. The
laughter, the chat, the aroma of boiling
coffee, the rattle of dishes being unpacked
reached them. They stood for a moment
in the shadow, then her hand left his and
they went to join the others.</p>

<p>The dozen men and women were grouped
about the pine-knot fire, for the warmth was
grateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
There was badinage and sally, light,
foolish stuff, perhaps, but flung like shining
nebul&aelig; along the way by youth in its whirl
of mere being. It is good to know how to
be frivolous sometimes. Alexina felt the
exhilaration of sudden gaiety, daring. She
sat down by the youth with the guitar and
the striped flannel coat.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>And both were young, and one was beautiful</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>warbled the owner to his guitar, making
room for her. &ldquo;Right here, Miss Blair, by
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than one presently stole a look at
the tall, rather handsome Miss Blair, hitherto
conceded reserved and different from her
mother. She was laughing contagiously
with the youth, and in the end she gained
the guitar over which they were wrangling.
She knew a thing or two about a guitar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
herself, it seemed&mdash;Charlotte Leroy could
have explained how&mdash;as many chords as
the owner anyhow. But the young Leroy,
it would appear, was sulky, certainly unsociable,
sitting there, removed to the outskirts
of things, to smoke and stare at the
moon. Yet never once did the girl look his
way. It was enough that they were to return
together.</p>

<p>Nor was she paying attention to Molly
either. There are times when the mad leap
and rush of one&rsquo;s own blood absorbs all consciousness.</p>

<p>Molly was gay, too, feverishly gay. Some
one had brewed a hot something for the
delectation and comforting of the chilly
ones, and Molly&rsquo;s thin little hand was holding
out her picnic cup as often as any one
would fill it. It was Mr. Jonas who presently
took the cup away and tried to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
wipe a stain off the pretty dress with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>When the start homeward was made,
King came over to Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to ask you to change to the large
boat going back,&rdquo; he said, a little stiffly
perhaps; &ldquo;Mr. Jonas is taking Mrs. Garnier
in the small one, and Mr. Henderson
says he will see to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she answered her voice was lightly
nonchalant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she said, absorbed in putting
on her jacket.</p>

<p>She took her place in the boat by Mr.
Henderson. Evidently the evening had
gone wrong with him, for his face was
ghastly in the moonlight, and his long,
nervous fingers never stopped fingering the
little gold cross hanging below the line of
his vest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
William Leroy did not return with the party
at all. Not that she was concerned with
that, Alexina assured herself proudly, it was
only that she could not help hearing the
others wondering at his entering a boat with
the negro boy and rowing swiftly away up
the lake. It was clear to her. Lake Nancy
would have been the next lake on the chain
had the channel been cut. He meant to tramp
across home to save himself the trouble of
going back to town. She did not think he
had very good manners at any rate. Yet,
when the boats came in at the hotel pier, it
was William Leroy who met them. He
waited for Alexina and walked with her a
little ahead of the others up through the
yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Garnier is not well,&rdquo; he told her.
&ldquo;I went home and drove in and Mr. Jonas
is putting her in the wagon now. We&rsquo;ll take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
her out to mother; she&rsquo;s all upset over
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stopped short, having forgotten her
mother. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; she declared;
&ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t right to Mrs. Leroy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s waiting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
better go in and say something to somebody,
and get Celeste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Leroy said that people always
obeyed the King William tone. Alexina
stood, hesitating. He waited.</p>

<p>Then she went.</p>

<p>He was in the wagonette when she and
Celeste came out. The place was still and
deserted, even Mr. Jonas gone, for which
Alexina was grateful.</p>

<p>Molly was on the back seat, and Celeste,
gaunt and taciturn, started to mount beside
her.</p>

<p>Molly protested. &ldquo;Not you, mammy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
go in front. I want Malise&mdash;not the big
Malise, you know&mdash;the little one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl, taking the wraps from the old
woman, got in by her mother and began to
put a shawl about her. The dew was falling
heavily. Molly touched her hand.
&ldquo;Once Alexander said to me, &lsquo;Let Malise
keep tight hold on you, Molly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>William Leroy was flicking the mules
travelling briskly through the sandy streets,
and talking to the old woman, but she was
sullen and the conversation died.</p>

<p>Alexina&rsquo;s heart was choking her. Her
father&mdash;daddy&mdash;Molly had spoken to her
of daddy.</p>

<p>And all the while Molly was talking on,
feverishly, incessantly. &ldquo;You must keep
him away, Malise, that minister, he worries
me and his eyes make me uncomfortable, following
me. He makes me remember things,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
and I don&rsquo;t want to. He says it&rsquo;s his duty.
He said to-night I&rsquo;m not going to get well
and that he had to tell me in order to save
me from myself. Make him keep away
from me, Malise; I&rsquo;m afraid of him. I took
it, <em>that</em>, to-night, to forget what he said;
say it isn&rsquo;t so, Malise&mdash;say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willy leaned back over the seat, talking
in steady, everyday fashion. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
moon setting ahead of us; see it, Mrs.
Garnier? Everything&rsquo;s so still, you say?
Why, no; it&rsquo;s not so still. There is a cock
crowing somewhere, and that must be a gopher
scuttling under the palmetto. Now,
look backward. See that line of light? It&rsquo;s
the dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER EIGHT</h3>


<p>The next evening at Nancy, an hour or two
after supper, King William was tapping at
Mrs. Garnier&rsquo;s door, which was ajar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is asleep,&rdquo; warned Alexina from
within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come on out,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;the
moon&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Mrs. Leroy told her, &ldquo;Willy
wants you,&rdquo; which to Charlotte was reason
for all things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s windy,&rdquo; he called softly, &ldquo;bring a
wrap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl came, bringing her reefer jacket
and her Tam and put them on in the hall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
The jacket was blue, the Tam was scarlet,
and both were jaunty. He regarded her in
them with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, there,&rdquo; said he, with King William
approval, &ldquo;I like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went down and out. She was tired,
she said, so they sat on the bench under the
wild orange. The moss, drooping from the
branches, fluttered above them. The wind
was fitful, lifting and dying. It was a grey
night, with scattered mists lying low over the
lake, while a shoal of little clouds were slipping
across the face of the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been too soft and warm,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;it can&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Alexina shivered a little, for there
was a chill whenever the wind rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk down to the pier,&rdquo; he begged,
&ldquo;and back. Then you shall go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The path led through the grove. Stopping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
to select an orange for her, he passed
his hand almost caressingly up and down a
limb of the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you begin to pick the oranges
Monday?&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked on. He was peeling away
the yellow rind that she might have a white
cup to drink from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be here to see the picking,&rdquo; said
Alexina. &ldquo;I have to go to Kentucky for
two weeks, something about business. Uncle
Austen wrote me in the letter you brought
out to-day, that it would simplify things if
I could come. And Emily&mdash;Emily Carringford,
you know&mdash;Uncle Austen&rsquo;s wife,
wrote too, asking me to stay with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monday. I&rsquo;ve been talking to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
mother, and she&rsquo;s willing, if Captain Leroy
and you are; I came out to ask you&mdash;I
am always to be asking favors of your family,
it seems&mdash;if you will let me leave Molly
here instead of at the hotel. Celeste can
attend to everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Willy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a business proposition,&rdquo; said
Alexina. But it took a bit of courage to
bring it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or I can&rsquo;t do it, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had reached the lake and were
sitting like children on the edge of the
pier. The water was ruffled, the incoming
waves white-crested, and the wind
was soughing a little around the boat-house
behind them. He was breaking bits off
a twig and flinging them out to see them
drift in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
&ldquo;Great country this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that can&rsquo;t
produce a pebble for a fellow to fling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked off toward the shining, shadowy
distance, where the moon gleamed against
the mists. &ldquo;You are&rdquo;&mdash;then he changed
the form of his question&mdash;&ldquo;are you very
rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave the very out, and, yes, I suppose
I am rich,&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are so&mdash;well&mdash;yourself,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;sometimes I find myself forgetting it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl swallowed once, twice, as if
from effort to speak. She was looking off,
too, against the far shore. &ldquo;Is it a thing to
have to be remembered?&rdquo; then she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said King William, turning on
her suddenly. There was a sharp harshness
in his tones. &ldquo;I wish to God it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got up, and he sprang up, too, facing
her. Suddenly she stamped her foot. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
wind, rising to a gale now, was blowing her
hair about her face and she was angry. It
made her beautiful. She might have been a
Valkyr, tall, wind-tossed.</p>

<p>But the sob in her voice was human.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had Uncle Austen say such things to
me in his fear I might let other people
forget it, and a girl I cared for at school let
it come between us, but I thought you&mdash;I
had a right to think you were bigger. Your
mother is, oh, yes, she is, and your father is.
Not that I despise the other, either.&rdquo; She
lifted her head defiantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand and
liberating thing, though it was shackles on
me in Uncle Austen&rsquo;s hands. I don&rsquo;t despise
it; I couldn&rsquo;t; but that it should have to
be remembered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Willy Leroy, in his father&rsquo;s
phrase.</p>

<p>Her head went up again and she looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
him full, straight, then turned and fled towards
the house.</p>

<p>He ran after her, came abreast, and after
the fashion he had, stooped to see into her
face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, in from me&mdash;mad,&rdquo;
he begged. Was he laughing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am mad,&rdquo; she returned promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t go in either way,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;stay, mad if you will, but stay. Oh,
I&rsquo;m not proud,&rdquo; he was breathing hard
again, &ldquo;that is&mdash;only this proud; I shall
build onto my little gold of Colchis until we
stand at least nearer equal&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each looked at the other, with defiance
almost. She was as beautiful as Harriet
Blair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ll be
that far less my equal. Let me go.&rdquo; And
she jerked her sleeve from his hand and ran
into the house.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER NINE</h3>


<p>The morning after dawned sunless and
chill. The sky was a pale leaden, below
which darker masses of clouds scurried.
The wind blew strong, steady, resistless.
At breakfast they all sat shivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have Pete start fires,&rdquo; said King William
to Charlotte, &ldquo;and you had better
move Mrs. Garnier over to my room before
night.&rdquo; For there were not fire-places in all
the rooms.</p>

<p>It was a dreary morning every way. The
breakfast was poor and scant. Aunt Mandy
defended herself. &ldquo;Ev&rsquo;y thing done give
out,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Charlotte been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
so occapied she done forgot to order things
f&rsquo;om town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Convicted, Charlotte looked at Willy, then
hastily took the defensive. &ldquo;Mandy ought
to have reminded me,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <em>ma&rsquo;am</em>,&rdquo; responded Mandy. &ldquo;I
done quit this thing uv tellin&rsquo; an&rsquo; havin&rsquo; you
say things give out too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willy sat stony. The Captain shivered.
One realized all at once that he was an old
man. &ldquo;The thermometer is at forty-six,
King,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the son, &ldquo;and falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All morning it fell. At noon it registered
forty degrees. The wind still swept a gale
that whistled and shrieked at the corners of
the house, and the three women passed the
morning in Charlotte&rsquo;s room, shivering
about the open fire-place. Pete spent his
day chopping and bringing in arm-loads of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
fat pine wood. All the sense of dissatisfaction
with Aden returned. Desolate grey
sand is a hideous exchange for sward, and
orange trees look like toys from a Noah&rsquo;s
ark.</p>

<p>At dinner there was a furrow between
King&rsquo;s straight, dark brows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s thirty-eight,&rdquo;
he told his father, &ldquo;and falling. It&rsquo;s
clearing, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Afterwards he was talking to Pete in the
hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; reiterated Pete, &ldquo;we&rsquo;s too far
below the line, ain&rsquo;t never heard of sech a
thing down here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At four o&rsquo;clock King came in to say he was
going to town. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s down to thirty-four,&rdquo;
he told his father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in and telegraph
up the river for reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what then, son?&rdquo; asked the Captain.
&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
It was a hitherto unexperienced danger
threatening Aden. But youth cannot sit
and wait. Alexina, from the window in
Charlotte&rsquo;s room, saw King William fling
himself on his horse at the gate and gallop
off. The wind had ceased. The live-oaks
on either side of the old iron gate stood motionless,
their moss hanging in dreary, sombre
lengths. There was no sound of bird or
insect. And it was cold&mdash;cold. Alexina had
a jacket over her woollen dress, for Aden
houses are not built for cold, which poured
in at casements, beneath doors, at keyholes.
Molly, on the couch drawn up to the fire,
coughed and coughed again. Alexina went
to her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cold,&rdquo; she complained; &ldquo;and
how dreary it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had cleared and the sky was a pale,
chilly blue. The sun set in a yellow pallor.
The night fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
King came in and warmed his hands at
the parlour fire. Alexina and Charlotte had
come down now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty-two,&rdquo; he told his father, &ldquo;and
falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither the Captain nor his son ate much
supper, but near-sighted Charlotte, absorbed
in things at hand, seemed unconscious
of anything more amiss than discomfort
from the cold. After supper the son
disappeared.</p>

<p>Molly was coughing sadly. They had
moved her bed across to Willy&rsquo;s sitting-room,
and a fire crackled on the stone hearth; but
it was to be one of the nights when she would
not sleep, or but fitfully, and when Celeste
and Alexina would not sleep either. At
nine o&rsquo;clock they persuaded her to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But talk, Malise, you and mammy talk.
I don&rsquo;t have chance to think when people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
keep on talking; and, mammy, rub my
hands; it helps, to have some one rub them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At ten she wanted a drink of water. Alexina
went to the window where she had set
a tumbler outside. The night was still and
clear, the stars glittering. The moon would
rise soon now. How large the grove showed
itself from this south window, stretching
away to the southwest around the curving
shores of Nancy. As Alexina opened the
window she shivered, despite the heavy wool
of her white wrapper. As she took in the
glass&mdash;was it? Yes, over the surface of
the water radiated a ferny, splintery film,
which was ice.</p>

<p>Molly, feverish and restless, drank it
thirstily, and said it was good, but it roused
her so that she began to talk again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said I couldn&rsquo;t prevent his praying
for me,&rdquo; she was harping on the minister.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
&ldquo;For my soul,&rdquo; she laughed uneasily. &ldquo;I
told him to let my soul alone. It&rsquo;s perfectly
funny, Malise, that I&rsquo;ve got to be prayed
over when I don&rsquo;t want to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night wore on. Celeste was nodding,
even while her brown hands went on rubbing
up and down the slim white wrist and
arm.</p>

<p>The wood on the andirons broke and fell
apart. The room grew shadowy. &ldquo;Build it
up, Malise,&rdquo; begged Molly; &ldquo;I like it light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no more wood up-stairs. It
was past twelve o&rsquo;clock and the house was
still. Alexina opened the door into the hall.
A lamp in case of need, because of Molly,
was burning on a stand. Alexina had remembered
that there was wood piled on
the parlour hearth. Her slippers were
noiseless.</p>

<p>Down-stairs she paused, then tip-toed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
the front door. The big thermometer and
barometer in one hung against a side of the
recess and could be seen through the glass
side-lights. It was bright moonlight now,
the shadows of the rose vine clear cut on the
porch floor. She looked at the thermometer.</p>

<p>She looked again.</p>

<p>It had come, then, what never had come
to Aden before. From the talk of the day
she had gleaned enough to know that the
fruit hanging on William Leroy&rsquo;s trees was
but so much sodden, worthless pulp.</p>

<p>She turned back towards the parlour where
the firelight was flickering out the doorway,
then stopped. He was in his father&rsquo;s chair
before the hearth. His elbow was on his
knee and the hand on which his chin was
propped was clenched. The flame flared
up. His face was haggard and harsh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
She fled back up-stairs. Molly had fallen
asleep, Celeste was nodding.</p>

<p>The girl shut the door and dropped in a
little heap on the bearskin before the fire.
She was shivering, but in her eyes, fixed on
the embers, was a yearning, brooding light
that made them beautiful. Then suddenly
she hid her face in her hands, her head
bowed on her knees, and began to sob.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TEN</h3>


<p>The Captain, Mrs. Leroy and Alexina, on
the gallery, watched King as he trudged
across the yard. He was going for his horse
that he might take a telegram into Aden for
Alexina, who was to leave the following
morning.</p>

<p>He trudged sturdily and was whistling
under his breath as he went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a debt&mdash;I owe it to you,&rdquo; said
the girl suddenly, turning on the Captain.
She spoke with vehemence, entreaty, passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We put that aside the other day&mdash;discussed,&rdquo;
said the Captain gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>You</em> did,&rdquo; declared the girl; &ldquo;but not&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t say I did. And Mrs. Leroy saw
the right, the justice of it, when I talked to
her up-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hadn&rsquo;t heard Georges then,&rdquo; Charlotte
hastened to say, &ldquo;and I see now how
you&rsquo;re trying to make a purely business affair
a personal one.&rdquo; Poor Charlotte, she
did not see anything of the kind; she was
quoting the Captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is a debt,&rdquo; declared the girl, crying
a little against her will, &ldquo;and you have
no right to refuse me. The whole transaction
was a taking advantage, and hard,
and mean; it was the pound of flesh, and you
said, Mrs. Leroy, that if the grove could be
held a year or two, and not sacrificed right
away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy will fight that part out,&rdquo; said
the Captain. The words sounded final, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
the hand laid on the girlish one clasping the
arm of his chair made it right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can he?&rdquo; she insisted, with stubbornness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the father.</p>

<p>The three sat silent. King, waving his
hat at them as he rode around, stooped from
his horse, opened the gate and went through.
He was not a person to be offered sympathy.
Right now he was absorbingly cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Leroy admitted,&rdquo; Alexina began
again, her under lip trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Alexina,&rdquo; said Charlotte hastily;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. Or I ought not to have,&rdquo; she
added honestly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never set myself
against Georges in things concerning Willy
since we came down here. We talked it out
then, Georges and I. It&rsquo;s been hard to see
Willy fighting things; he was born imperious,
but he&rsquo;s used to battling now. I see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
what Georges meant. It&rsquo;s better for people
to learn how to battle. If I had ever been
taught&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun was slanting in under the old,
wild orange tree on to the gallery. Again the
three sat silent. Then out of the silence the
Captain spoke. He was an old man who
had laid down the burden of labour to lift
and carry the heavier load of inaction in
silence, as he had carried the other. His
tone was impersonal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a giant wrestler, one Ant&aelig;us
of Lybia, if I remember my classics, Alexina.
King used to lie on the rug when you both
were children and read you about him. So
many times as this Ant&aelig;us was brought
to earth, he arose renewed, if I recall. The
boy must wrestle with his own fate.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h3>


<p>On entering Uncle Austen&rsquo;s house, self-consciousness
and constraint closed in like bars
across the door of spontaneity. Alexina
had arrived the night before and they were
at breakfast. Uncle Austen was facetiously
affable, and his sportive sallies, not being
natural with him, embarrassed his audience.
There is something almost pitiable in the
sight of middle-age grown playful.</p>

<p>Emily, Uncle Austen&rsquo;s wife&mdash;embarrassing
realization in itself&mdash;looked in her plate
constrainedly, so that Alexina, if only that
his further playfulness might be prevented,
threw herself into the conversation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
chattered volubly, but in vain, for Uncle Austen
found chance to reply.</p>

<p>There was complacency in his facetiousness,
too. He had married him a wife, and
the pride of the thing coming to him this
late made him a little absurd, and yet,
Alexina reflected, he was a man of big
ability and varied interests, prominent in
whatever large enterprises the city boasted,
banks, railroads, bridges; a power in the
Republican party of his state, his name
standing for respectability, wealth, and conservatism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking pretty good care of your old
friend Emily, Alexina?&rdquo; Uncle Austen was
demanding playfully, as he arose from the
table; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s standing transplanting pretty
well, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily got up abruptly, so abruptly her
chair would have turned over but for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
quickness in getting there to catch it, but
his good humour was proof even against this,
though he ordinarily frowned at awkwardness.
He set the chair in place, and taking
Emily&rsquo;s hand as they all went from the
room, patted it ostentatiously. Alexina
grew hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty hand, a hand for a man to be
proud to own, eh, Alexina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily almost snatched it away and paused
at the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He was finding his overcoat and feeling
for his gloves. Then he took a little whisk-broom
from the rack drawer and brushed
his hat with nicety. He was smiling with
high humour. The man&rsquo;s content was almost
fatuous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have you here, Alexina,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;very glad. I will feel that Emily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
is having the companionship she ought to
have in my absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The click of the door as he closed it
seemed to breathe a brisk and satisfied complacency.
Emily had fled up-stairs. Alexina
followed her slowly.</p>

<p>How strange it seemed to hear her moving
about in what had been Aunt Harriet&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>Alexina went in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might at least have refurnished it,
mightn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Emily, with a laugh. It
was not a pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you like for dinner?&rdquo; she
asked Alexina, her hand on the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it doesn&rsquo;t cost too much,&rdquo; said Emily,
laughing the laugh that was not pleasant.</p>

<p>Later, the conferences with the servants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
over, she sat down to make certain entries
in the ledger, open on the desk. Alexina
picked up a magazine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He asked me one day,&rdquo; said Emily,
turning, &ldquo;what had become of an end of
roast that ought to have come back made
over, and said there must be waste in the
kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Alexina. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,
Emily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? You knew it all before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina flushed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly,
&ldquo;I did. I knew it&mdash;before. How are
your mother and the little girls, Emily?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother&mdash;oh, all right. He told me to
ask Nan and Nell over every Friday from
school to supper, and mother and father and
Oliver over to Sunday night tea. &lsquo;It ought,
in the end,&rsquo; he told me, &lsquo;to make an appreciable
saving in your mother&rsquo;s providing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>346]</a></span>
these continued absences from stated
meals.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, Emily. Tell me about
the winter. Have you been gay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gay?&rdquo; Emily wheeled from the desk.
She gazed at Alexina almost wildly. Then
she laughed again. &ldquo;Gay! oh, my great
Heaven&mdash;gay! Then you don&rsquo;t know? I
am going to bear him a child&mdash;and, oh,
help me somehow; Alexina, I loathe him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A child, Uncle Austen and Emily a child!
A warmth swept out of Alexina&rsquo;s very soul
and enveloped her. She knew, and she did
not know. Other women and girls had
taken it for granted always that she knew,
and talked on before her. It meant to her
something vague, unapproachable, veiled,
and a great, overwhelming consciousness
stifled and choked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went out on the platform of the train
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
while we were away,&rdquo; Emily was saying,
Emily who never, even in childhood, had
curbed a mood, a dislike, a humour, &ldquo;and
tried to throw myself off, but I was afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina shrank. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t listen&mdash;you
mustn&rsquo;t tell me&mdash;it&rsquo;s between you and
him, Emily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily had gotten up and was walking
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He offered Oliver a place in the bank, to
please me, I thought. Oliver&rsquo;s nineteen
now. The place had been paying eighteen
dollars a week, and Oliver had only been
making twelve. So he offered it to him at
fifteen. &lsquo;To the benefiting of both sides,&rsquo;
he came home and told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily stood still, her eyes tearless and
hard. &ldquo;Put on your wraps, Alexina, and
we&rsquo;ll go drive. It&rsquo;s like a duty, a task, the
exercising of the horses. It hangs over me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
like a nightmare that I&rsquo;ve got it to do, until
I&rsquo;ve gone out and gotten it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Alexina, on familiar ground,
&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ve hated those horses too, before
you. But you ought to be like Aunt
Harriet, Emily; don&rsquo;t be like me&mdash;tell him
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emily, unlocking the wardrobe door, suddenly
flung up her arms against it and hid
her face in them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried, I have tried,
and I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m afraid of him,
Alexina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the child coming&mdash;their child?
Perhaps the child would make it right.
When it came, Emily would love her child?
Perhaps she did; she never talked about it
afterwards, and Alexina never saw her with
it; it died in the summer, soon after its coming.</p>

<p>When she did see the two again, her uncle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>349]</a></span>
and Emily, on her own return to Louisville
in the late fall, the embarrassing playfulness
had left Uncle Austen. Perhaps the steely
coldness of his manner was worse. Had
Emily dared&mdash;even in her mourning there
was something about her that was reckless.
But she did not dare. She was twenty-two
and he was fifty-two, and she was to live
afraid of him, to see him an old man, for he
is living now.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER TWELVE</h3>


<p>Harriet laughed at Alexina&rsquo;s wonder over
her. &ldquo;It took me a time to realize that
hospitality means the incidental oftener than
the invited,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;My guests,
you know, Alexina, were formally asked, and
the other would have fretted me. That was
why, I suppose, I had no intimates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harriet never knew, it would seem, these
days, whether the Judge, the Colonel, Father
Ryan, the man from the office chatting
in the library with the Major, one or all,
were going to stay for supper or were not;
yet she had come to the place where she
could smile in serene and genuine welcome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>351]</a></span>
the while everybody moved up and the coloured
housemaid slipped in an extra chair
and plate.</p>

<p>And she only laid a hand on the spoon
with which little Stevie hammered his plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take it away and spank him myself,
you know,&rdquo; confided Louise, Stevie&rsquo;s mother,
to Alexina; &ldquo;I do spank William.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all of life seemed to be moving for
Harriet with serenity. Every trivial happening
was swallowed up in the joy that
death had spared her her husband. And
the Major, whatever the agony, the horror,
preceding the acceptation of a maimed life,
had not lost the vital grace of humour. Life
flowed in and out of the Rathbone home
with him for centre as it had used to do in
and out of his office. The room where he
sat amid his papers and books was a rallying
place because the strong will and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
personality of the man in the wheeled chair
made it so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been meaning for years to do a
series of guerrilla articles a magazine has
wanted of him, and now he&rsquo;s at them,&rdquo; said
Harriet, &ldquo;and he has given in this far, in his
stiff-necked pride, that he&rsquo;s bought an interest
in the paper for me, and it keeps him in
touch and absorbed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Major had been watching Alexina.
At the end of several days&rsquo; observations he
leaned back in his chair and addressed
her. His eyes were humorous. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
an encouraging promise about you, Alexina,&rdquo;
he informed her. Then he caressed
his lean chin with his lean, smooth hand.
&ldquo;A promise that gives me hope. You&rsquo;ve
laughed at my jokes since you&rsquo;ve been
here, and not from mere politeness either.
Now, Harriet smiles out of the goodness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
of her heart because she thinks she ought
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he caught at Harriet&rsquo;s hand even
while they all three laughed, for it was patent
to everybody that Harriet had no idea
what his jokes were about, which was the
amusing thing of all, seeing that it was the
Major&rsquo;s humour that she confessed had
attracted her.</p>

<p>And yet the eyes of the man often deepened
and glowed as he watched her move
about the house, for she made even the
trivial duties seem beautiful because of her
unconscious earnestness and her joy in
their doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h3>


<p>On the return to Aden, that last hour on the
train, Alexina was trembling. She was
glad, glad to be back, yet of the actual moment
of arrival she was afraid.</p>

<p>It was Peter, and alone, who met her at
the station with the wagonette. The high
ecstasy of her shrinking fell like collapsing
walls beneath her. Life was grey, level, flat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Garnier&rsquo;s po&rsquo;ly this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Pete
told her as they drove homeward. &ldquo;Mis&rsquo;
Cha&rsquo;lotte wouldn&rsquo;t leave her to come, and
Mr. Willy, he&rsquo;s been gone for a week now,
down to the grasswater with a pahty of
gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men, as guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
She felt strangely tired and quiet. It was
going to be hard to seem as glad to be back
as she ought. Yet the world, as they drove
out to Nancy, was rioting in bud, and new
leaf and bloom. Magnolias were uplifting
giant ivory cups of heavy sweetness; every
tree-trunk, rail and stump bore a clambering
weight of yellow jasmine bloom; the tai-tai
drooped pendulous fringes of faintest
fragrance, and wild convolvulus ran riot
over the palmetto. There were bird-song
and sunshine and ecstasy everywhere.</p>

<p>And she could not feel glad, she could not
feel glad.</p>

<p>Promptly Molly dragged the girl off to
their room. She looked slighter and more
wistful-eyed and bored to death. &ldquo;You
promised me that we would go early in
March, if I stayed out here&mdash;you promised,
Malise. And I&rsquo;ve stayed. You promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>356]</a></span>
we&rsquo;d go to The Bay, where there are people
and hotels and it&rsquo;s gay. And it&rsquo;s March
now. You look so tall and cold, Malise!
what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina, restless and absent, wandered out
on the porch to the Captain. She chatted to
him about Louisville, but there were sharpening
angles about his face that made her
heart ache. She went up to Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we are going to do,
Alexina,&rdquo; Charlotte told her. &ldquo;Willy said
I was not to think or worry about it, I was
to put it all aside until he got back. But it
hurts. He went off looking so gaunt. I
don&rsquo;t believe he slept a night through after
the freeze; all hours I could hear him up,
walking around, but he don&rsquo;t like it if I notice,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina dropped down and put her head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>357]</a></span>
in Charlotte&rsquo;s lap and cried, and Charlotte
patted the girl&rsquo;s wealth of shining hair and
cried too.</p>

<p>But since he could go without a sign to
her, Alexina could go too. That day she
wrote for rooms at The Bay Hotel. The answer
came that she could have what she
wanted by the eighth. She told Mrs. Leroy
she and Molly would go on that date.</p>

<p>She could leave without a sign too, she
had said, but in her heart there was joy that
Fate had given her to the eighth. She would
not have moved a finger to stay, but since he
was to return on the sixth, why&mdash;</p>

<p>But the very day the letter from The Bay
reached her, a Seminole came up from the
glades with game from King and a note.
The party was considering making a longer
stay, he wrote to his mother, so she need not
worry in case he did not return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>358]</a></span>
&ldquo;I told him in my answer,&rdquo; said Charlotte,
&ldquo;that you all were going. Dear me,
I&rsquo;ll miss you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he would know, he would know, and
if he did not come it would be because it was
his desire not to.</p>

<p>Molly confessed to a few bills in town.
Malise had left money, yet Molly had managed
to make accounts at a fruiterer&rsquo;s, the
caf&eacute;, as it called itself, the drug store, the
stationer&rsquo;s, and the two dry-goods establishments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re not stingy like the
Blairs,&rdquo; Molly told her; &ldquo;you know, Malise,
they&rsquo;re really mean. Your grandfather Blair
carried you out to their gate once to see a
hand-organ man and his monkey. You were
too pleased for anything, and when the man
finally moved away your grandfather told
you, &lsquo;Say good-by to the monkey, Alexina.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>359]</a></span>
Truth to tell, Molly and Charlotte seemed
to have had a fine time in the absence of
their two youthful monitors. Charlotte
was as wax in the naughty Molly&rsquo;s hands.
Even now, with Alexina on the scene, Molly
proceeded to put Mrs. Leroy up to a thing
that never would have entered that innocent
soul&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Charlotte went mysteriously to town one
morning, Peter in his best clothes driving
her, and came back beaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked some of the Aden young people
out for the evening before you go,&rdquo; she
told Alexina. &ldquo;The halls and the parlours
are so big, you can dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte beamed and Molly looked
innocent. Alexina gazed at Mrs. Leroy
dismayed. What would the Captain,
what would King William think? It
would never occur to Mrs. Leroy until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>360]</a></span>
afterward that she could not afford such
a thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to do it together,&rdquo; said
Alexina privately to her. &ldquo;Molly and I owe
Aden some return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charlotte was made to see it. Had Willy
come along, she would have seen it as speedily
after his will, be that what it might.</p>

<p>Whatever the Captain thought, he sat unmoved
in the midst of the deluge of water
and mopping that suddenly swept about him
on the porch. There must have been
Dutch in Charlotte somewhere, for hospitality
with her meant excess of cleaning.</p>

<p>It was a miserable week altogether to
Alexina. The days dragged through to
their nights, and the nights to morning.
She had never known so hateful a time. She
hated the grove, where thousands of oranges,
gathered into piles, lay rotting, and where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>361]</a></span>
the smiling trees, wherever their buds had
escaped injury, were putting out scattered
blooms; she hated the lake, and the Cherokee
roses in bloom, she hated the crepe myrtles
and the camelias in the yard. To walk
meant wading through sand; there was nothing
in town to make the drive worth while.
The shame, the sting was in everything that
was beautiful. That she should care!</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas and Mr. Henderson drove out
one evening, Mr. Jonas to talk over matters
with the Captain. Alexina wandered off by
herself.</p>

<p>Presently she heard Mrs. Leroy calling
softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your mother,&rdquo; she told Alexina
in a whisper, as the girl came back to the
house. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Henderson is
good for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was talking to Mr. Jonas rapidly,
eagerly, like one defending self, as Alexina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>362]</a></span>
reached them. Mr. Henderson was regarding
her out of sombre eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I think I&rsquo;m sick,&rdquo; Molly
was saying, &ldquo;like he says I am. I&rsquo;m better,
really, much better, only while he was talking
about, about things&mdash;it&rsquo;s a dreadful religion
his; I&rsquo;d rather be without any, like
Jean, than have one like his&mdash;I remembered
how Father Bonot used to pull the oranges
for me I couldn&rsquo;t reach. Here&rsquo;s Malise
come back. Malise, let&rsquo;s not go to The
Bay after all; I&rsquo;m tired; let&rsquo;s go to Cannes
Brul&eacute;e. He&rsquo;s there, Father Bonot is, they
told me in Washington. He&rsquo;s an old, old
man. Let&rsquo;s go back home there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;if you want,
we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were a little baby at Cannes Brul&eacute;e&mdash;yes,&rdquo;
animatedly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do.
We&rsquo;ll go home to Father Bonot, Malise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>363]</a></span>
At the touch of Mr. Jonas the minister
started. His face was grey. Then he got
up and followed the other. On the way in
to Aden in the buckboard he hardly spoke
until the hotel was reached.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas stopped the mare before the
plank sidewalk. The minister came to himself
as out of chaos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Jonas turned the wheel. &ldquo;Only
yours?&rdquo; he rejoined briskly.</p>

<p>The minister, on the sidewalk now, looked
up at him dazedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
you mean,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; returned Mr. Jonas, with
cheerful reassurance; &ldquo;you will, you will,
though.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">So again Alexina made plans. They
would go on the eighth as before, she and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>364]</a></span>
Celeste and Molly, but they would go to
Cannes Brul&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Supper was over and the Captain sat
smoking in his cane chair on the gallery. If
King was coming, it would be to-night; the
train from the South came in at seven, and
he knew that they were going.</p>

<p>Alexina, sitting on the steps below him,
was glad it was the Captain out here with
her, rather than the others. It was like
the quiet and cover of twilight, the silence
of the Captain. Moving a little, she put
a hand upon the arm of his chair. His
closed upon it and his eyes rested on her
young, beautiful profile, though she did not
know it.</p>

<p>The moon came up. The clock in the
hall struck eight. Molly was lying on the
sofa inside, Mrs. Leroy moving about as
was her wont, straightening after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>365]</a></span>
servants had gone, and innocently unsystematizing
what little system they employed.</p>

<p>Outside sat the man and the girl. There
were night calls from birds and insects, but
beyond these sounds the girl&rsquo;s heart listening,
heard&mdash;</p>

<p>Between where the road emerged from
the hummock and the gate to Nancy was a
stretch of old corduroy road over a marshy
strip. Elsewhere a horse&rsquo;s hoofs sank into
sand. Willy Leroy would ride out, if he
came, probably on Mr. Jonas&rsquo;s mare.</p>

<p>The girl sat, all else abeyant, listening.
She heard the first hoof-beat, the first clattering
thud on wood. Her hand slipped
from the Captain&rsquo;s; she sat still.</p>

<p>She sat stiller even as Willy rode in and
called halloo to the house, while his mother
and Molly, and even Celeste, came out.
She hardly moved as he touched her hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>366]</a></span>
and went past her with the others into the
house, and left her there.</p>

<p>She did not know how long it was they
came and went, Pete with the horse to the
stable, Mrs. Leroy getting the boy his supper.
The talk of the father and mother and son
rose and fell within.</p>

<p>She heard them closing shutters, hunting
lamps, and moving up the steps. But he
came out and sat on the step near her, and
yet far away.</p>

<p>They did not look toward each other.
And yet he knew how she looked, fair, still,
perhaps a little cold; and she knew how he
looked, tanned and bronzed, yet good to see
in his hunting clothes.</p>

<p>Shy as two young, wild things they sat,
and wordless.</p>

<p>Presently he spoke, looking away from
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>367]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mother wrote me you were going. I
came up to say good-by. They&rsquo;re to wait
for me in camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that they both were silent, how long
neither knew. Then the girl stood up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be late,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll find it is.
Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h3>


<p>In her packing Alexina had left out a muslin
dress for Mrs. Leroy&rsquo;s evening. Going up
from the hurried supper to dress, she
glanced at it, then drew forth a box from a
trunk and pulled the contents therefrom.
The dress that came forth shimmered and
gleamed and floated; it was a thing that
must have enfolded any woman to beautiful
lines, and have made any throat, any head,
lift. It was a purchase she had been in a
way ashamed of, tempted to it in a moment
of weakness, urged on by Molly.</p>

<p>Now she laid it forth and dressed with
care, grave as some young priestess. Molly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>369]</a></span>
watched her curiously. Even at the hotel
there had been occasions for only simple
clothes.</p>

<p>But the girl even brought forth some leather
cases. Generally it was her little pose
that she did not care for jewels, but in her
heart she loved them, as every woman does,
primitive or civilized, young or three-score-and-ten.
Now she put on what she had.
Of late the fairness of Malise had deepened
into abiding beauty, yet to-night it was the
garb she was emphasizing it would seem,
and what it stood for, not the personality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re curious,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;I would
have thought it was a time for the simplest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you?&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>The evening turned into a really spontaneous
little affair. It was the sort of thing
the young people of Aden&mdash;dwellers in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>370]</a></span>
various frame houses about the town, all sojourners
from a common cause, somebody&rsquo;s
health&mdash;it was the sort of thing
these young people got up about every other
night in the year. Two mandolins, a violin,
and a harp made music. A college boy with
a cough, and a Mexican bar-keeper played
the mandolins, the local boot and shoe dealer
the violin, an Italian the harp, and the
whole called itself a string band.</p>

<p>Charlotte Leroy, in a rejuvenated dress of
former splendour, was a beaming soul of delight.
That Alexina, Willy and Celeste had
really seen to everything Charlotte had no
idea, for neither had she sat down that day.</p>

<p>But she beamed now while Molly&rsquo;s low
laughter rose softly.</p>

<p>Alexina rearranged lights and adjusted
decorations. She went out to the kitchen
and took a reassuring survey. Later, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>371]</a></span>
told the Aden youths who asked, she didn&rsquo;t
believe she meant to dance. They did not
press her; perhaps it was the gown, perhaps
it was her manner preventing. She laughed,
as if it mattered! She talked with Mr.
Jonas, but all the time she knew that William
Leroy, in his white flannel clothes, was
outside, smoking, on the gallery. After a
while she went out. He was leaning against
a pillar, and turned at her step. The night
was flooded as by an ecstasy of moonlight.
His eyes swept her bare shoulders and arms,
the shimmering dress, the jewels, then turning,
he looked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and dance,&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own fault,&rdquo; said the girl as
promptly; &ldquo;you climbed up on back sheds
at dancing school so you wouldn&rsquo;t have to
learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>372]</a></span>
&ldquo;It gave me my own satisfaction at the
time,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much that&rsquo;s your own fault,&rdquo;
she returned, &ldquo;and which you cover up by
pretending that you don&rsquo;t like or want.
You&rsquo;re as human as any one else. You
make yourself believe you don&rsquo;t want things
because you&rsquo;re stubborn and proud, but you
do, you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under proper conditions,&rdquo; he admitted
largely, &ldquo;I might, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under any conditions, in your heart you
want them, we all want them; you&rsquo;re not
different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not honest, that is what then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;and what then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was almost crying. &ldquo;You exonerate
yourself, you condone yourself, you say you
would, you could, you will&mdash;some day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>373]</a></span>
if&mdash;if thus and so. You think some better
condition is going to bring the confidence to
be what nature meant you to be; yes, you do
think it, you do, you do. But it has to grow
out of yourself. I can tell you that, and
when the time you think for comes, to be
what you&rsquo;d like to be, you&rsquo;ll have lost the
power. I want to say it, I mean to say it, I
want to hurt you, I hope my saying it can
hurt you, so I can go away glad, glad I&rsquo;ve
hurt you. There, I&rsquo;ve said it; don&rsquo;t stop
me, don&rsquo;t; I came to say it and I&rsquo;m going
back now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was breathing hard. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo; He glanced around. Then he
stepped down from the gallery and turned.
&ldquo;Come, let yourself go, I&rsquo;ll steady you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, brushing some wet from her
cheek with her hand. She did not know until
then there had been tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>374]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he reiterated. It was the tone
women, even Molly, obeyed.</p>

<p>She slipped down and he caught her and
set her on her feet. &ldquo;Pick up your dress,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;the grass is wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everywhere, it seemed, there were couples
strolling. Around to the right, by the side
door, with its little, vine-covered pent-house,
was a bench beneath a tree; Aunt Mandy
and Mrs. Leroy aired their crocks and pans
thereon. He led the way to it, spread out
his handkerchief, and Alexina, gathering up
her gleaming dress, sat down. The comical
side of it must have occurred to him, the girl
gathering up a dress fit for a princess, to sit
there. He laughed, not an altogether humorous
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Illustrative of the true state of things, as
it were,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I proffer my lady a
milk-bench.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>375]</a></span>
A sob rose in her throat. &ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo;
she said hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you bestow feeling of any sort, to
such degree, is flattering,&rdquo; said he nastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It puts us on a sort of equality, and establishes
me in my own self-respect, so to
speak, to have face to be rude to <i>une grande
dame</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not honest, and you know it, and
it&rsquo;s hurting you while you&rsquo;re doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said William, after the fashion
of his father. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve said what I had to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came after her. &ldquo;And now you shall
listen.&rdquo; They stood and looked at each
other. Her eyes measured him with some
scorn, his met the look squarely. &ldquo;I care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>376]</a></span>
for you as the only thing worth while in
life,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not so much pride left you need
think you have to say that to save it,&rdquo; she
burst forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the one not true now. You
know it, you have known it right along. I
hadn&rsquo;t even the arts of your world to know
how to conceal it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My world!&rdquo; said Alexina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; let&rsquo;s both be honest. I&rsquo;ve
fought it because I&rsquo;ve had enough decency
to see the impossibility&mdash;oh, my God!&mdash;what&rsquo;s
the use being fool enough to talk
about it. I haven&rsquo;t one cent on earth that&rsquo;s
my own; I&rsquo;m worse than a beggar, if we are
going to be quite honest about matters, since
I am a debtor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Alexina; &ldquo;oh, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fought it out, or thought I had, down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>377]</a></span>
there in the glades, and then got up and
came back because I couldn&rsquo;t let you go&mdash;without&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; said Alexina, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do know,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,
I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alexina!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her young face was white and solemn in
the moonlight, but her eyes came up to his
with a splendid courage. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>

<p>It might have been a moment, an hour, a
day, an &aelig;on, the two looked at each other.
Then their hands went out to each other, for
very need of human touch in the great awe
of it.</p>

<p>When he spoke both were trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you wait?&rdquo; he asked her. &ldquo;It may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>378]</a></span>
be long.&rdquo; But the note in his voice was new.
The fight even then was begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she told him, grave eyes meeting
grave eyes, for young love is solemn. Then
he drew her to him and sight and sound
went out, and the solid round earth was
spurned. And yet they were but two of the
long, unending line, mounting thus to God
and His heaven, for it is for this we are come
into the world.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alexina slipped her hands from
his and fled.</p>

<p>Molly was on the porch with Mr. Jonas.
A toy harness from the cotillion favors jangled
on her dress. She had sunk laughing
on a bench to get breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she told Mr. Jonas, &ldquo;we go in the
morning, to Cannes Brul&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexina was coming up on the porch
and to Molly. Straight she slipped to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>379]</a></span>
knees and her arms went around her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Malise,&rdquo; said Molly.</p>

<p>The head of the girl hid itself in the curve
of the mother&rsquo;s neck and shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Malise,&rdquo; said Molly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
such a child.&rdquo;</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
